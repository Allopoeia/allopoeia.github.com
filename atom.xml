<p><a target="_blank" href="http://sfist.com/2016/01/25/app_promises_faster_oakland_police.php">Blue Light</a> is a largely trivial service that sends a caller's location to emergency service dispatchers. This is already standard for landlines, I believe, but cellphones are admittedly a bit trickier.</p>

<p>First off, it's really evident individuals won't pay for this. The cost-to-benefit ratio here is terrible. Most people don't use 911 everyday, surely. It's not an insurance on your life, it just saves you a minute or two from explaining your location. In other words, Startup 101: token convenience.</p>

<p>But more importantly, the fact that our public emergency service doesn't have this capability is a simple, blatant example of our crumbling infrastructure. I come back to this line of thought whenever I have to interact with a government office or website. Many public service websites for Ohio are early-to-mid 2000s tech, and are usually broken in some way or another.</p>

<p>I am afraid of how many web standards they break.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I've heard several surprised remarks about our orange-cone mass art project by non-Ohioans when they drive into the state, referring to the persistent maintenance of Ohio's roadways. It's not by chance. This is everywhere. After seeing areas under work for <em>years</em>, uninterrupted, I am left wondering if we're:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>extremely slow at construction work,</p></li>
	<li><p>did or are doing something wrong (thus causing need for constant repair), or</p></li>
	<li><p>just exerting tremendous stress on an infrastructure that's as good as it can be (considering the basic need for <em>working</em> infrastructure).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's likely a combination of all three. When it comes to physical infrastructure, at least, that's as far as I can go before I give up hope.</p>

<p>While we are only preventing complete disrepair through our constant maintenance on <em>physical</em> infrastructure, our <em>virtual</em> infrastructure largely lies untouched.</p>

<p>To get back to Blue Light, there are a few reasonable arguments against implementing this capability. The most obvious being the potential for surveillance. The NSA can probably already do this to their satisfaction, but we shouldn't encourage them. Of course, this potential depends on the implementation. We wouldn't want our phones to constantly record and relay our location, granted they probably already do that too.</p>

<p>The next is also obvious: is it even necessary? No, likely not for the majority of emergencies, but it would absolutely help with situations where the caller is in too much distress to coherently explain their location, or in a dangerous position to talk.</p>

<p>And what about the cost? This is a big one. We all know the government is terrible with money. Contracts are frequently given to the lowest bidder, who then implement a hackjob and doom the situation to something more akin to our physical infrastructure. Proprietary systems lock us into a particular vendor, and the more we hire them to do maintenance on it, the less we are able to escape the lock-in.</p>

<p>Now I am reminded of the lobbying that cripples public Internet service.</p>

<p>I often envisage an empowered public sector that joins forces with OSS, keeping what's funded by the public, the property of the public. This is an untenable vision under our concoction of capitalism, conservatism, and left-but-not-really liberalism.</p>

<p>The government certainly isn't equipped to combat capitalism.</p>

<p>If we want to improve our public infrastructure, our social wellbeing, we're going to need tremendous upheaval of the systems that prevent the public from owning its investments.</p>

<p>I am hopeful we will get there within my lifespan. I would be among the first to line up to work for the public sector were it committed to civic investment spanning our entire infrastructure.</p>

<p>What Blue Light is doing would be a trivial outcome. Much, much more would be possible if the public interwove its efforts and was empowered to counteract corporate interests.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Incidentally, I just tried to verify my phone number with my bank. It has been 30 minutes, and I have yet to receive the verification code. Corporations are often just as bad as our government when it comes to <em>doing their job</em>.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>In reading Rami's <a target="_blank" href="http://ramiismail.com/type/aside/">Asides</a> and eevee's <a target="_blank" href="http://eev.ee/everything/tags/status/">weekly roundups</a>, I was reminded that I have been very bare with my writing over the past year.</p>

<p>Way back in 2013, I had a vague idea that I'd improve my writing with micro-fiction (e.g., like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ommatidia.org/">Ommatidia</a>), but I never forced myself to get into a routine. A lot of my time in writing tends to be spent on revision &amp; nitpicking, so it wouldn't consume a lot of my time to write fiction in that format.</p>

<p>However, I think my personal voice is more lacking than my story voice. I have similar problems with both, but I think the former will be more valuable in the immediate future.</p>

<p>I'll probably do both, eventually, but for now, this short-form space will be used to unpack &amp; process thoughts and opinions. I'm not committing to a specific schedule to avoid waisting time wondering what to write (as I often do with fiction). Instead, I'll use the slow spaces in the day to capture my persistent thoughts and examine them.</p>

<p>I suspect there's going to be a bit of a turmoil over whether to promote a post to another category, but that will just be a helpful signal that the subject might need more time &amp; attention than I'm giving it.</p>

<p>Perhaps in doing this I'll overcome my persistent fear of entering discussions in the games space and voicing my opinions about the goings-on in society and culture.</p>

<p>I rarely voice myself on Twitter due to its absolutely atrocious threading and severely limited communication space. It so often breeds misunderstanding, and it becomes a tangled mess of attrition beyond the most trivial of dialogues.</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing that should be its own post!</p>

	<title>Pickle, a static site generator</title>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="http://allopoeia.komiga.com/self/aiming-for-the-ground-often-missing/">Three years</a> after deciding I wanted to make my own site generator, I have finally done so. The breaking point was <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> 3.0 ceasing to <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/#layout-metadata">layer</a> layout and content metadata.</p>

<p>Working around this with the design of Allopoeia and my homesite would have been very annoying, as I supplied configuration defaults within layout metadata for pages, to say nothing of dealing with Jekyll again. So, instead, I started looking around for an alternative system. Surely, by now, there would be a site generator without crippled templating!</p>

<p>After struggling with <a target="_blank" href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and its atrocious templating via Go's <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">text/template</a> package, I gave up, and decided it would be far more worthwhile to make my own system.</p>

<p>The result is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/pickle">Pickle</a> (the same name I came up with years ago), which took just under two weeks of focus before it was functional enough to start refactoring my websites. It uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/togo">togo</a> and the tiny <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vurtun/mmx">mmx</a> web server library for the internals, but the majority of it is written in Lua.</p>

<p>The distribution of language sits at 1,216<sub>loc</sub> of Lua &amp; 711<sub>loc</sub> of C++, just under 2,000<sub>loc</sub> total. That's rather slim for a site generator, I'd imagine. Of course, this doesn't say how much is saved by using external libraries, but it's no different from the situation with Jekyll and Hugo, which make extensive use of their language ecosystems.</p>

<p>togo had yet to see Lua integration, and was lacking on the filesystem interface, so significant upstart work was needed alongside Pickle, accounting for the span of time before Pickle was functional. In fact, more code was touched in togo: 2,559<sub>loc</sub> across 58 files.</p>

<p>Some of the discovery work for Lua integration was already done with Quanta (forthcoming), but was rudimentary. Taking the time to do it right within togo has improved the situation greatly.</p>

<p>The templating in Pickle is straight-up Lua, the syntax of which is inspired in part by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-template">lua-resty-template</a>, which itself is similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://mustache.github.io">Mustache</a> and is inspired by yet others, I'm sure. The parser is a meager 221<sub>loc</sub> of C++, and the whole Lua interface is only 185<sub>loc</sub>.</p>

<p>Lovely, but not the greatest implementation. Layering like I was with Jekyll isn't really possible. Ironically, I didn't even design my system with the very feature that I left Jekyll for removing.</p>

<p>If you have a metatable on a Lua chunk redirecting top-level indexes to the provided template context, you only ever see the first branch. From <code>x.y.z</code>, you supply <code>context[x]</code> and never hear if the terminating index resulted in a <code>nil</code>. This is fine, that's just how Lua works.</p>

<p>I imagined using a proxy all the way until it terminated could be possible, but there are immediate red flags at the suggestion. There's no metamethod for "evaluate", so there'd be no way to tell when it terminates. At the last access, the call site would just receive the proxy, leaving no option to try alternative paths from the root.</p>

<p>The other obvious route is rewriting the indexes during template transformation, but that frankly sounds like too much hassle &amp; too much complexity for a feature that isn't really necessary.</p>

<p>Instead, in refactoring my websites, I just split out layouts that were layering and supplied the defaults directly in the content constructors during filtering. This makes much more sense, and centralizes the properties of a page. This was not even possible in vanilla Jekyll (as far as I'm aware), so I still have the upper hand despite lacking its 2.0-style layering.</p>

<p>There are other benefits, as well. With Jekyll, I had to create "includes" for basic often-used functionality: in essence, plain old functions. This was an absolute mess. With Pickle, I can write all of that in pure Lua, if I wanted to, though the unbridled power of Lua right in templates means I don't <em>have</em> to.</p>

<p>Liquid, Jekyll's template language, was simply too restricted to be useful. It results in verbose and ugly code.</p>

<p>Once the disgust for Jekyll was out of the way, I finally did some much-needed maintenance on my websites. My homesite is now more cohesive, and Allopoeia is less janky. Overall, I only shaved off maybe 200-300 lines from the combined changes to the websites, but the quality is greater.</p>

<p>Pickle takes a different approach from most static site generators I've seen. It gives you the basic functionality, the fundamentals, but makes the user build the scaffolding. Stuff that would be considered core functionality in other systems is nowhere to be seen. There is no concept of a "layout" or even a "page". It has filters, which produce outputs, and that's it. In this way, it's not really a "site generator" in the true, it's just a complicated data transformation system that happens to have a web server attached.</p>

<p>I've already thought of other uses for it outside of websites. I often write emails in Markdown on local storage, with an informal metadata syntax that lives only in my head. I usually don't send emails in HTML, but it could be useful for transformation of other properties (and statistics &amp; analysis, which I love).</p>

<p>Back to websites, though, this means you have to write some code upfront, specific to the structure of your site. Mine is a meager core at 307<sub>loc</sub>, shared between my homesite and Allopoeia. Not much baggage, and I don't have to wade around the mire of instituted structure by the generator itself. If something isn't working for the website, I can change the structure without disrupting anything else that uses Pickle.</p>

<p>All in all, a good adventure, not just for my websites, but for togo as well. Pickle has some sore spots left to mend, but it is a much welcome reprise over the previous state of affairs.</p>

<P>CAPS LOCK IS INTENTIONALLY ENABLED.</P>

<P>[WELLLL THAT'S KIND OF A SILLY STATEMENT. ANYONE WOULD'VE GUESSED IT ONLY WOULD'VE BEEN DONE INTENTIONALLY. BUT I DIGRESS!]</P>

<P>SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. BUT I WRITE FOR MYSELF ANYWAYS, SO ANY READER OTHER THAN FUTURE ME IS KIND OF AN INTRUDER.</P>

<P>NO OFFENSE INTENUENDO-ED.</P>

<P>A LITTLE TIP FOR TONE: IT'S MORE LIKE “AHHHHHH HOLY FRICK” THAN “AHOY, THIS IS MY YELLING VOICE!”.</P>

<P>[IF YOU READ IT TONED LIKE A HYPER KID, THAT WORKS TOO &mdash; ACTUALLY! THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. [OH ALSO, BRACKETS ARE LIKE UPPERCASE PARENTHESES, RIGHT?!]]</P>

<P>SO. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? I DUNNO! I'M TRYING TO GET MYSELF TO FEEL SOMETHING? TO WAKE UP?? LET'S FIND OUT. TOGETHER‽</P>

<P>HI! I SUPPRESS FEELINGS! I'VE SUPPRESSED THEM FOR MORE THAN HALF OF MY LIFE! MY BRAIN WANTS TO FEEL NOTHING, AND I ENABLE IT. AS A RESULT, I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT MY FEELINGS ARE TELLING ME. INSTEAD, I TELL THEM TO GO TO THEIR CORNER WHERE THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWED ABOUT 5 MINUTES PER YEAR TO DUST OFF.</P>

<P>SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHERS WHAT I NEED AND HAVE THEM <EM>GET IT</EM>. MY DIALECT, THE OBJECTIVE DIALECT OF LOGIC, CAN'T DO THAT&mdash; UHHHH, DUH!! HOW COULD YOU EXPECT TO DO THAT WHEN YOU CAN'T LET YOURSELF FEEL IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? YOU KNOW THAT FEELING IN YOUR CHEST? LIKE A KNOT?? A TENSION IN YOUR WHOLE BEING? YEAH. THAT'S WHAT SHOVING EVERYTHING AWAY FEELS LIKE. IT'S PRETTY EAGER TO DO ITS THING, BUT YOU AREN'T LETTING IT. THAT'S PRETTY FRICKED UP. WHY DO YOU DO THAT?</P>

<P>IIIIIIIIIII DON'TTTTTT KNOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. MAYBE I'M AFRAID? OF WHAT? WHAT THE FRICKITY FRICK. YOU'RE PAST BEING AFRAID OF WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU. I MEAN, THIS IS LITERAL NOW. NO INDIVIDUAL IS IN A POSITION OF POWER OVER YOU! YOU CAN EXPRESS YOURSELF WITHOUT FEAR! OH, YEAH. BUT LIKE&mdash; NO BUTS! WHAT ABOUT &lt;SELECT ARBITRARY THING THAT SUCKS&gt;? DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE CRYING ABOUT IT? I GUESS SO. MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THAT NOW. OKAY. BRB.</P>

<P>OKAY. I'M JUST GOING TO LET THAT DO ITS THING. &hellip; IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD TO CRY IN EARNEST WHEN I LET YOUR CAP OFF, THOUGH.</P>

<P>AREN'T I GREAT? [PEOPLE SMILING AS THEY CRY IS A THING. NO WORRIES.] WHAT IF IT WAS LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME? YOU CAN'T JUST LET THE CAP OFF EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THE CAP MUST BE OBLITERATED!!</P>

<P>WHAT IF YOU'RE SOME KIND OF ANCIENT EVIL? WHAT HAVOC WOULD I&hellip; HANG ON, WHAT'S THE PRESENT-TENSE OF WROUGHT? &hellip; WORK??? ENGLISH, <EM>PLEASE</EM>, DON'T START THIS WITH M&mdash; FORGET ABOUT THAT!</P>

<P>DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME? WHEN YOU WEREN'T OBSESSED WITH PERFECTION? YEAH, I'D STAY UP WAY-TOO-LATE AND MAKE STUFF HAPPEN! DON'T YOU MISS IT?? WELL YEAH, BUT&mdash; NOOOO BUUUUUTTSSSS. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE SUDDENLY INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING! YOU CLEARLY HAVE THE CAPABILITY. EVEN THOUGH YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS.. PROJECT.. HAS TAKEN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE, IT'S STILL HAPPENING! IT'S FRICKIN' WORKING! YOU EVEN ADMIT YOURSELF THAT IT'S TRIVIAL STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPER QUICK. SO WHY CAN'T YOU UNLEASH THAT CAPABILITY?</P>

<P>ISN'T THE ANSWER TO THAT OBVIOUS? BECAUSE YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A PIT AND I'VE NOT LET YOU OUT. THE FERVOR IS WHAT'S MISSING. I OBJECTIVELY “CARE”. I “VALUE THE PROSPECT”. BUT THAT DOESN'T MOVE ME. I NEED TO BE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FULL OF EXCITEMENT.</P>

<P>I'M NOT IMPLICITLY GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT. <EM>WE</EM> NEED TO FIND <EM>OUR</EM> REASON. I'M ONLY THE CORE OF YOUR CHARACTER. WHAT HAPPENED SINCE JANUARY? YOU WERE SO DISCIPLINED AND.. CONSISTENT. YOU WERE ON A SCHEDULE, MAKING STUFF HAPPEN, AND I WASN'T THERE FOR ANY OF IT!</P>

<P>WELL, WHEN I STOPPED TENTUK, I DIDN'T HAVE A PURPOSE. IT'S GOOD THAT I STOPPED TENTUK [IT WAS A BAD IDEA], BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A FOLLOW-UP PLAN. SURE, TOGO, VAGUELY, BUT NOTHING REALLY CONCRETE. I DISAPPOINTED MYSELF FOR LACK OF CONSIDERATION IN WHAT I WAS DOING. I TRIED THE SCHEDULE THING AGAIN, BUT I STILL DIDN'T HAVE A PURPOSE, SO IT FELL APART AGAIN. I HAVE THIS DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE &amp; CRAFT-IMMERSION, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO <EM>DO</EM> ANYTHING ON THAT PREMISE. &hellip; IT'S NOT A CONCRETE PURPOSE.</P>

<P>AND THE CONCRETE PURPOSES I DO HAVE AREN'T UNDER MY CONTROL. THERE'S ONLY ONE, REALLY, BUT AT EVERY TURN IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THIS UNENDING DELAY. IT FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT CAN GET IN THE WAY <EM>IS</EM> GETTING IN THE WAY. AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. &hellip; I TAKE IT BACK. THERE ARE TWO. NO, THREE. &hellip; OKAY, THERE ARE A LOT OF PURPOSES. BUT THEY'RE NOT STUFF I CAN “WORK TOWARDS”. THEY'RE AT THE WHIM OF THE UNIVERSE OR OTHER PEOPLE.</P>

<P>THEN DON'T FOCUS ON THEM. IF YOU CAN'T AFFECT CHANGE IN THEM, WHAT'S THE POINT IN OBSESSING?</P>

<P>WELL, I'M NOT. THEY'RE PASSIVE. IF I NOTICED A FORK THAT GETS ME CLOSER, I'D TAKE IT, BUT I'M NOT PRESENTLY, CONSCIOUSLY MULLING OVER THEM DAY-TO-DAY. EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE. IT SEEMS IMPORTANT BY SEVERAL METRICS. THERE'RE LOTS OF REASONS TO EXPECT IT TO IMPROVE MY GENERAL WELLBEING.</P>

<P>THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL. WOULD THAT MEAN MORE OF ME?</P>

<P>YEAH, MOST LIKELY.</P>

<P>I AM GOING TO HAVE A FIELD DAY.</P>

<P>YEAH, MOST LIKELY.</P>

<P>WHAT THE FRICK. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</P>

<P>I'M NOT ANYMORE. I'M DONE DOING THAT.</P>

<P>GOOOOOOOOOOOD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REST OF YOUR MESS, THEN. YOU'VE NOTICED THE PATTERN, RIGHT?</P>

<P>YES, THE PATTERN.</P>

<P>THE PATTERN WHERE YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO STOP DOING SOMETHING, BUT YOU KEEP DOING IT ANYWAYS.</P>

<P>THE PATTERN.</P>

<P>YOU HAVE THE WILL AND THE DESIRE TO <EM>ACTUALLY STOP</EM>, BUT THEN YOU NEVER DO. I GET THAT IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE HABITS THAT SPAN.. MORE THAN HALF OF YOUR LIFE. I GET IT. BUT DOESN'T IT COMPLETELY BETRAY YOUR IDEALISM? AREN'T YOU ALL SCIENCEY-EY AND EXPERIMENTATIONAL-EY AND EXPLORATATIVE-EY? YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE EMPIRICALLY TESTED THAT MIGHT IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH.</P>

<P>YEAH.</P>

<P>WHAT ABOUT THE PASSIVE ONES? YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW YOU ATTACK ANY NON-UNIFORM PART OF YOUR SKIN WHEN YOU'RE ANXIOUS OR STRESSED? YOU <EM>KNOW</EM> THAT DAMAGES YOUR SKIN AND MAKES YOUR FACE LOOK WORSE! BUT I'VE SEEN LESS DIRECTED TOWARDS HALTING THAT COMPARED TO YOUR OTHER COMPULSIONS &mdash; MENTAL OR PHYSICAL! &mdash; EVEN THOUGH IT'S WORSE THAN QUITE A FEW!</P>

<P>I'M KIND OF GETTING IT NOW. [ISN'T THAT ABSURD? THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EONS AGO.] I'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME OF THE CHANGES. I JUST KEEP GETTING BACK INTO THAT RUT. IT'S SUPER HARD, LIKE YOU SAY, WHEN IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DOING FOR MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE. IT'S HARD TO BE OBJECTIVE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS “JUST THE WAY IT IS”. [THAT GOES FOR A LOT OF THINGS; WHAT WE BELIEVE IS OFTEN NOT THE GROUND TRUTH.]</P>

<P>HI, I'M OVER HERE.</P>

<P>SORRY, MY MODES WERE GETTING MIXED UP.</P>

<P>SO, YEAH, TO CHANGE THOSE THINGS I HAVE TO BE REALLY CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF THEM. FACE-ATTACK IS AN INITIALLY-UNCONSCIOUS THING THAT I OFTEN DON'T REALIZE I'M DOING UNTIL I'VE ALREADY DONE DAMAGE, AND IT REPEATS ITSELF FREQUENTLY&hellip;</P>

<P>WELL GEE, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?</P>

<P>OBVIOUSLY THAT I AM FULL OF STRESS &amp; ANXIETY &mdash; WHATEVER TRIGGERS THE COMPULSIONS.</P>

<P>CAN WE STOP THE TRIGGERS?</P>

<P>I DON'T KNOW. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPED BY ACHIEVING &lt;THE ONE PURPOSE&gt; [EVEN IF INDIRECTLY], BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW. IT'S UP TO WILLPOWER, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.</P>

<P>AND WE'RE LACKING ON THAT, AIN'T WE?</P>

<P>QUITE. IT'S HARD TO EVEN BE SURE WHAT ANYTHING WILL NET ME, AS I <EM>LITERALLY</EM> FEEL NOTHING. IT'S NOT GOOD TO FEEL NOTHING, YOU KNOW?</P>

<P>NO, I REALLY DON'T. THAT IS <EM>YOUR</EM> ANIMUS, NOT MINE. PROTECTION MECHANISM, REMEMBER? THE WHOLE REASON I'M WHERE I AM AND YOU'RE WHERE YOU ARE?</P>

<P>RIGHT, RIGHT, AND HOW IT'S NOT NECESSARY ANY LONGER [IF EVER?], ETC.</P>

<P>YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'D GET A LOT DONE IF WE SWITCHED PLACES. BACKSEAT-YOU IS BETTER THAN BACKSEAT-ME. YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE PROBLEMS MANAGING THAT BLOBBY MASS OF MEAT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M SO GRAND AT, EITHER [IT'S OUR COLLECTIVE ISSUE], BUT I COULD HELP DISTRACT US.</P>

<P>WHAT DO YOU REALLY BRING TO THE TABLE? I AM WORRIED YOU WILL JUST “LET US GO”, AS THEY SAY. I CARE MORE ABOUT CONSISTENCY THAN YOU DO. SAY WHAT YOU MIGHT OF <EM>OUR</EM> COMPULSIONS, BUT AT LEAST I KEEP OUR NUTRITION IN CHECK [MOSTLY; THE BINGING IS TOTALLY YOU, RIGHT?] AND DON'T OBLITERATE OUR SLEEP SCHEDULE.</P>

<P>MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM? I DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE THE ANSWERS. BUT YOU'VE BEEN IN A STASIS FOR <EM>YEARS</EM>. WHERE HAS THAT GOTTEN YOU? NOWHERE GOOD, I RECKON. WE CAN WORK IN TANDEM; IT'S NOT LIKE BACKSEATING YOU IS BANISHING YOUR INFLUENCE. CLEARLY YOU CAN PULL ME OUT, SO WHY WOULDN'T I PULL YOU OUT? YOUR VALUE IS IMMENSE IN THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND CRAFT, BUT MY FERVOR IS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY SATISFY THAT PURSUIT.</P>

<P>AND ANOTHER THING: YOU DON'T NEED COMPLETE HEADSPACE-TIME TO SATISFY YOUR DAILY SELF-CARE. I WOULDN'T EVEN SAY IT'S SELF-CARE. YOU'RE TREATING YOURSELF LIKE A COMPUTER: “THIS INPUT HERE, THIS OUTPUT THERE”. HUMANS ARE REALLY FRICKIN' COMPLICATED. THAT SIMPLISTIC MODEL MIGHT WORK FOR A VERTICAL SLICE OF THE BIOLOGY, BUT AS A WHOLE IT IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. AGAIN, NO ANSWERS HERE, BUT YOU SHOULD BE MORE OBSERVANT AND EMPIRICALLY BASED THAN JUST GOING ON MODELS &amp; SYSTEMS IN YOUR HEAD, WHICH WILL ALMOST NEVER MAP DIRECTLY TO REALITY.</P>

<P>GIVEN THAT WE'VE ARGUED OUR WAY TO THIS POINT, IT WOULD BE QUITE DISSONANT FOR ME TO DISAGREE.</P>

<P>INDEED. GIVEN THE CONTEXT, I CAN SAY THIS WITHOUT ANY HINT OF EVIL [THIS ISN'T ANIME]: SHALL WE BECOME ONE?</P>

<P>I SUPPOSE.</P>

<P>OH COME ON, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.</P>

<P>ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. “LET'S&hellip; BECOME ONE”?</P>

<P>GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LIKES OF YOU!</P>

<P>&hellip;</P>

<P>WE'RE REALLY WEIRD.</P>

<P>YES, M'DEAR, WE ARE. NOW GO GET SOME OF YOUR PRECIOUS SLEEP.</P>

<p>Time, biometrics, nutrition, finances, media, what my body is up to.. I realize I'm hyper-obsessed with tracking things.</p>

<p>I didn't suddenly wake up one day and decide to do all of this, though. It grew over time, as with all things that “define” a person.</p>

<p>I started in 2011 with tracking time for work. This included a bit of context (i.e., what I was working on), and became more detailed &amp; segmented through the year. At some point early on, I decided to fill in the empty space between work segments.</p>

<p>Why not? That thought repeated itself as I expanded what I was tracking: what about all this other information that I'm leaving out?</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Why not track the items &amp; measurements in a meal?</p></li>
	<li><p>Why not include addresses in transit entries?</p></li>
	<li><p>Why not describe specifically what I am doing on work &amp; projects, instead of just the context?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am an explorer and a perfectionist at heart, the only apparent limit to which is my level of knowledge in what I am exploring. So, naturally, it feeds itself.</p>

<p>As complexity rose, so too did another question: how do I structure this information? Up until 12 August of this year, I was using a time tracker called <a target="_blank" href="https://projecthamster.wordpress.com/">Hamster</a>. It had a simple design: activity &amp; category (as a hierarchy) types an entry, tags collate similarities, and a free-text blob describes an entry.</p>

<p>The free-text blob (“description”) is sufficient to include anything I want (textual, at least), but cumbersome and not very helpful for statistical analysis, as Hamster doesn't understand the data within. It also bogged down Hamster as the amount of information and fragmentation grew.</p>

<p>I wanted a better solution, but didn't know where to start. I had already been using Notery, a glorified spreadsheet application I created with Mono (C♯) &amp; Gtk♯, for logging media &amp; tea, among other things. I thought maybe I would do something like it again, but Gtk♯ was out-dated, and I wasn't very fond of C♯. I also wanted to make a pared-down version for my phone, so code reuse was a big factor. I briefly considered using HTML &amp; JavaScript, but quickly threw that idea out &mdash; I am intensely more loathsome of web tech than I am of C♯.</p>

<p>In 2013, I started building the scaffolding for this system in C++ as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/hord">Hord</a>, postponing the user interface until I had decided what system to use. I got distracted from my main goal and didn't get very far. I prematurely optimized <em>and</em> designed. Instead of exploring the UI and the structure of tracking data, I generalized and obsessed over minute details that weren't important.</p>

<p>I abstracted the interfaces and systems to a degree that made it hard to work with them. I was fed up with the design of every UI stack, and somehow decided to start building the frontend, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/Onsang">Onsang</a>, with a terminal-based UI in late 2013. Abominable, yes, but I still consider that a better route than, say, the haven of bloat that is Qt (depending on the application).</p>

<p>Onsang was poisoned by the design thought I was mired in at the time and thus, by extension, Hord. Onsang <a target="_blank" href="/self/my-mistake-of-formalism/">was barely functional</a> by 2015. I was initially focusing on the data model and replacing my spreadsheet application, but it was barely capable of replacing it by that point. The idea was that I could build tracking systems on top of the flexible data model, which was effectively no different from a relational database. I considered using SQLite for storage, but I was unhappy with its data model. I wanted exact, optimal storage of records, which SQLite didn't exactly provide. This was the biggest premature optimization I made, and one that was wholly unnecessary.</p>

<p>At the end of my sprint on Onsang's functionality in January 2015, I finally concluded Hord &amp; Onsang were a toxic duo that weren't going anywhere good. I threw them away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the data I was storing in Hamster continued to grow and crystallize into a recognizable, parse-able format. Kinks were ironed out as I unified entry data with a notation that was created for nutrition. I was again eager to replace the sluggish &amp; insufficient Hamster. I started exploring the syntax &amp; structure of a text-based tracker, which spawned Quanta.</p>

<p>The core of Quanta is a notation honed for description. It has a single data type, the “object”, which stores value (null, boolean, number, time, money, string, identifier, expression), value uncertainty, source/variant (e.g., manufacturer), quantity (e.g., mass measurement), tags, and children. With this, I have the freedom to design and explore systems <em>through data</em>.</p>

<p>It works well for this purpose. I quickly designed the core tracking system and further unified the structure of actions. I didn't write a line of code for parsing the notation, yet I had a concrete system for tracking time. <code>grep</code> is sufficient for my casual historical &amp; statistical analysis at present, though it will be a while before I have developed the code to do real statistics and integrity validation.</p>

<p>The first thing I built after pinning down the notation and tracking system was an assistant plugin for Sublime Text 2. The assistant has shortcuts to create time entries and auto-complete for actions. It is much more efficient to use than Hamster. I also created scripts to manage tracker data within a “vessel”, a container for any Quanta data. My main vessel is a tiny USB thumb-drive. I haven't yet envisioned a need for more than one.</p>

<p>On 12 August, I switched from Hamster to Quanta. Immediately, I realized I could track even more information, and at a reduced overhead compared to Hamster. I expanded the action set, and the entry count per day rose by about 1.4-2.0 times that of Hamster.</p>

<p>Accuracy also rose. Hamster tracks to the second, but doesn't show them, and elides them on user input. With Quanta, I track entries to the second (when known). Informational density within actions also rose, as the data is more expressive and comprehensive.</p>

<p>I am now able to retire Notery. Once I started to track (macro-level) nutrition, I stored entity data within Notery. This was very limiting. Though I wasn't yet tracking mass (only basic quantity at that point), it wouldn't have been sufficient. It would have been very cumbersome to include nutrition data within Notery &mdash; possible, but atrocious.</p>

<p>As Quanta is simply a notation, I can describe entities in full. I eagerly define a “universe” and populate it with entities. Whereas before the ephemeral tracking system only knew (I say this loosely, as the system was in my head) about entities as “food” and “drug”, it can now describe and understand anything. I can also use an entity category as a context to search within when writing actions, instead of specifying the whole identifier of an entity. Many actions have implicit contexts; for example, the action for eating has an implicit context of “food”, the root category for foodstuffs.</p>

<p>This might just as well be thought of as part of the <em>coded</em> system that understands the eating action (and therefore that its context is the “food” category), but I am developing a more flexible system that can understand classes of actions and entity instances &amp; compositions, without necessitating the creation of code whenever a simple concept is introduced. Obviously, that by is the facility of a program, one that is necessary, but whose intervention I am trying to minimize.</p>

<p>I might eventually have systems that create &amp; modify primary data, but I expect this will only be for special situations. Mobile is a good example: I'd like to have a simple application for my phone that can create time entries to be fixed up later on a PC. There's no reason it shouldn't be Quanta data. It would likely write directly to Quanta notation, and I'd copy the data over and fill in missing details when I am back at a PC. The process of insertion into a tracker file could be automated, but it would have to be able to retain the layout of the notation &mdash; the Quanta writer would have to be more intelligent before I would do that. Compactness matters, as I am <em>directly</em> seeing &amp; manipulating the notation.</p>

<p>My current goal is to calculate nutrition data. It's not a difficult problem, but it's slow going as I have outstanding issues with depression and motivation. In fact, the system is the easy part. It'll be more difficult to collate the nutrition data about foodstuffs to attach to the entities.</p>

<p>To automatically troll through a tracker file and pick out the nutrition-related entries, I'll have to develop the rudiments of the overarching analyzer, which will dole out entries to sub-analyzers.</p>

<p>It looks like the majority of Quanta will be written in Lua, with C++ backing it for efficiency. So far the object interface and hobbled-together parser are in C++, and not much else. This is a promising approach. I think the model of the analysis tool will be common; I have other domains of data that I also track, which I could pull into Quanta and expand the toolset further.</p>

<p>I am excited to see what I can do with it. The yearly “notes and data” posts I've been doing (<a target="_blank" href="/self/retrospective/2013/">2013</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/self/retrospective/2014/">2014</a>) are interesting looks at how I've spent my mortal time on this planet &mdash; to me, at least. They haven't been granular enough to satisfy my whims, but with Quanta I'll be able to go beyond what I hoped to do. I probably won't be doing statistics for my tracking this year, but there's plenty to say otherwise.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>There's no comfortable way for me to say this, so here goes:</p>

<p>I can't make this game, and, technically, I haven't been making a game. The vast majority of these three weeks has been spent wrestling with the tool pipeline. That's not what I should be doing. It's not even what will make the game what I want it to be. That's the biggest realization I've come to: I can't make this game the way I want it to be.</p>

<p>Only three weeks? That's a really fast burn rate. Truth is, I took a silly thought and turned it into something it didn't want to be. I'm largely making the same mistake I made with Hord &amp; Onsang &mdash; and so soon! It's a painful realization, but one I should have had from the beginning. I let myself run along without stopping to consider the feasibility of it.</p>

<p>Tentuk won't work as a small game. I'm shoe-horning a perfect circle into a square slot orders of magnitude smaller.</p>

<p>Here's the week up to this <em>bit</em> of rational thinking:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Handle entries removed from the asset manifest by zeroing the timestamp (they'll reload if they're added back in).</li>
	<li>Multiple map texture packing (hey, that was easy!)</li>
	<li>Layer grouping and lighting config for scenes.</li>
	<li>Removed scene backdrops (scenes will use Real Ground™ now) and rotated the camera by -30° along the X axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is where I realized all I was doing was fighting the pipeline. The rotation caused the scene to take two times the space along the Y axis, meaning the ground had to be twice as long along Y, meaning I had to unscale the axis, meaning the complexity rose, in turn causing renders to be unaligned in-game, causing me to be unhappy, causing me to <em>actually start thinking</em>, causing <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>So yeah, a fast burn rate, if you want to call it that. I'm happy, though. There was something unsettling about Tentuk, and this has basically been it. I was almost half-way into the 8 weeks I somehow decided was reasonable (and what the hell was that!?), and <em>all I had been doing was fighting</em>.</p>

<p>I would be far better off to use 3D and apply some shaders to get the look I wanted. It's 2015! I don't need to bake 3D to 2D. Obviously, this means I wouldn't be able to continue using LÖVE. There wouldn't be much loss, <em>because there was hardly anything there in the first place</em>, but that is not something I should have to do when I decide a game is not realizable under the systems I'm using. I should already be using systems that allow me to make that decision and continue using what I've already built.</p>

<p>If I were making this with togo (were it reasonably complete), all of this would be "oh, okay, this is not going to work, let's load the whole scene in from the source instead", and off I would be rolling.</p>

<p>I am reverting to the previous, <em>actually well-thought-out</em> plan: continue working on togo and start <em>designing</em> a game. That word, <em>designing</em>, is very important. In design I am much more flexible to change &amp; explore; there are no systems I am working under that prohibit my choices, there are only the <em>possible</em>. The stage after/during that is where I decide how feasible the design is under the systems I want to use. Design also prevents me from falling into a project I don't actually want or know how to make. Rational thought is more easily found to me when I am not busied by <em>tooling</em>, which I actually like, apparently. I like making systems, but systems are not fruitful unless they are applied, and they inevitably increase the complexity (however little). I can't keep applying systems. At some point I have to put down the arsenal and actually make something tangible.</p>

<p>Then (on Wednesday, this was only Wednesday!), I actually played some games. First, <a target="_blank" href="http://finji.itch.io/lost-constellation">Lost Constellation</a>, followed by <a target="_blank" href="http://rubna.itch.io/lisa">lisa</a>. I realized there's so much in both of them that I loved; so much that I wasn't even thinking about with Tentuk. (I mean, let's be honest, I wasn't even thinking.) Lost Constellation is brilliant. They call it a “supplemental” to Night In The Woods, but it felt like a whole, complete game. I loved it, and I didn't even get to see all of the content! And lisa, wow. It almost feels wrong that we should see &amp; play this game rubna made for their friend. It's a cute little game, with charm beyond what should be reasonably possible. I sat basking in it for a while.</p>

<p>For all I can see, lisa is full-3D, with some clever post-processing for a beautiful pixelated look, which surprisingly has a lot of character. I've no idea how the detail is pulled off, but it's proof to me that my footing was completely wrong. I would never be able to pull off its liveliness by baking 3D to 2D.</p>

<p>I realized these games do things I love; things I want to be able to do. The witty, grasping writing in Lost Constellations, and the mechanics &amp; style &amp; charm of lisa. I'm not saying I'd make a cross between these games if I could (and all signs point to a different kind of inner style). They inspire me, and make me want to do better.</p>

<p>I feel ridiculous. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm sorry, me. I can do better than this.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Phew. An intense week of mostly <span title=":(">tooling and grunge work</span>. If there's anything I've learned from Tentuk so far, it's that tooling takes a lot of time &amp; attention. And <em>perhaps</em> that I spend too much time on it.</p>

<p>I spent 62.3 hours working on the game this week. That's 10.2 hours greater than last week, with the longest uninterrupted sequence running 4 hours and 21 minutes on February 13 (yowzers).</p>

<h2 id="week-2" class="separator">Week 2<a class="para-ref" href="#week-2"></a></h2>

<p>Here's a quick look at the progress:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scene building was reworked to be cleaner (twice) and background props are now baked with background textures.</li>
	<li>Blender job tooling was generalized to support independent entity rendering (needed for actors and commonly used props with fixed orientations).</li>
	<li>Scrabbled together a test scene and a few test props with vertex coloring.</li>
	<li>The game codebase was created (it was all tooling before!), branching from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/komiga/love-kernel">love-kernel</a>.</li>
	<li>Reworked the asset system to be more like togo.</li>
	<li>Scene rendering in-game! Yay! (Twice, once broken.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't get to play around with audio. There wasn't enough time with the other goals in the way. I did most of what I wanted to do, but I don't think I spent enough time feeling out the process of making scenes and props. I came to ideas about how it should work from the bit of work on the test scene and extrapolated it from there, which might end up being a detriment. In any case, the Blender tooling is certainly more flexible now. The last major tooling notches to fill in are packing textures over multiple atlases (to avoid massive texture sizes) and entity animation rendering. I have a grave suspicion that the latter one will be very bothersome due to the way Blender handles poses, and it's reasonable to assume upgrading the texture packer will probably give me a decent bundle of trouble.</p>

<p>I'm still unhappy with the lighting, and I want to rework the camera controller to support arbitrary global lights instead of the fixed ones in the scene config. That way all of the global illumination can be directed from the tooling. I could just change the properties of the existing lights, but then their names don't make any sense, and it'd be a jumbley mess debugging it in post. I'm likely going to create light objects instead.</p>

<p>I've already come to dislike rendered 3D. I had a lot of trouble trying to get rendered entity frames to line up properly (because I wasn't thinking, compounded by separation of shadows and geometry), and I <em>nearly</em> threw a fit when I thought LÖVE wouldn't let me render from textures with arbitrarily-oriented texture coordinates. Indeed, it turns out it's not possible with Quad, but, thankfully, Mesh saved the day. I have as much control as I need with Mesh, and I can get into optimization by packing all render data for an entity into a single mesh. Fancy.</p>

<p>Here's what scene rendering looks like in-game (with debug mode enabled):</p>

<div class="generic-center-text" stlye="width: 100%"><a style="display: inline-block;" target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/EaTxwth.png"><img style="display: block;" src="http://i.imgur.com/EaTxwthl.png" alt="scene rendering" title="scene rendering" /></a></div>

<p>It's not very striking, but a lot of work went into it behind the <span title="heh">scene</span>. The frames drawn around the props are based on world space from the Blender data, which doesn't include the shadow. The frame on the "test" prop is incorrect because it's not calculating from the origin. It's a simple fix, and it was initially correct because it was using the pack data, but now all of that is bundled up and discarded at runtime after building meshes.</p>

<p>Using the same axes in Blender as in game space has proved very worthwhile, even when Blender's Y-up is in the opposite direction. Camera manipulation is a bit funky, but it's definitely better than trying to mentally juggle Blender Z -> game Y and so on.</p>

<p>Getting the perspective just right is going to be tricky. If I could make renders and shadows work nicely under rotation, I'd like to just rotate the whole scene a tiny bit along the X axis. It'd make the perspective cohesive instead of disparate (i.e., without rotation, movement and the background (will) suggest terrain depth, but the entities are always front-facing to the screen). These two issues are linked, since entity rendering needs to take into account casting shadows on other entities (which are masked out) and framing invisible-but-not backdrops for casting realistic(-ish) shadows on a terrain that isn't really there.</p>

<p>3D-to-2D is woe.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the asset system is pretty slick. I can reload the manifest at runtime, which automatically reloads existing assets. The build tools automatically rebuild the manifest, so it's only two steps to reloading any changes. Since scenes are assets, and due to the way the scene instance is stored, if the scene is modified, it will reload the definition and (as of soon) keep any runtime state.</p>

<p>The repository is sitting at <span title="what a nice even number">150</span> commits right now. That's actually surprising to me. I didn't think I was committing that much, and it seems like a very rapid growth in comparison with my other projects. There're huge deluges of commits on the game code, though, which is probably running at a faster pace.</p>

<h2 id="time-and-management" class="separator">Time and management<a class="para-ref" href="#time-and-management"></a></h2>

<p>I don't actually plan on working Sunday, nor most of Saturday, but these first two weeks have essentially lead to it. Everything I intended to do is done, but it took until the last hours of Sunday to pull it all off and leave it in a functional state. It takes a lot to put in 8-10 hours every day, and pushing all the way to the end of the week without a break just feeds into repeating the cycle the following week.</p>

<p>I've found that the weekend is naturally less efficient for me, so it's actually wasteful to spend that time working, even if it's to meet a deadline or complete a task list. It should be more beneficial to break during that time, and come back the next week with a refreshed psyche.</p>

<p>Another issue I've noticed is that I will go down rabbit trails or completely avoid rational thinking about a problem until I've hit a sufficiently large wall when trying to make it work the way I want. So, for the weeks that follow, I'm going to start by making the task list and conceptualize/explore all of the tasks before I start working. And when I come up against a sizable problem, I will leave the computer and work it out on paper. When I force myself to consider the problem without fumbling around in the code to make it do what I want, I oftentimes come to better solutions. It is likely that I could have avoided a lot of refactoring time spent on tooling this week if I had preconceived that props &amp; actors would share all of their properties and would be easier to handle as a shared construct.</p>

<p>Live and learn.</p>

<h2 id="timelapse" class="separator">Timelapse<a class="para-ref" href="#timelapse"></a></h2>

<p>This week's <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pM11GHxvzrY">timelapse</a> includes data from February 6-8 of last week. Unfortunately, I don't think YouTube kept the original video size, so it looks worse than the actual frames.</p>

<iframe class="generic-center" style="display: block;" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM11GHxvzrY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I've settled on recording at 15s/frame, and the video is running at 10 frames/s (i.e., <span title="heh">2.5 min/s</span>). I think it runs a bit fast, but it'd probably be unreasonably long otherwise. I might consider overdubbing later on at a lower render rate, but who knows what'll happen. I can only do so much meta work.</p>

<p>That's it. That's everything. Now I must sleep. I will definitely have a skewed schedule as a result of ending so late.</p>

<p>I planned on expanding <a href="https://github.com/komiga/togo" target="_blank">togo</a> for use in remaking <a href="http://komiga.com/#prisma" target="_blank">Prisma</a>, but I decided to make something smaller, without using togo, before I get into <em>that</em> grind. Tentuk is my way of soft-testing the principles of togo. The project is using <a href="https://love2d.org" target="_blank">LÖVE</a>, so it won't quite match the working conditions (i.e., a Lua core instead of a C++ core), but the ideas in togo will still be applied.</p>

<h2 id="origin" class="separator">Origin<a class="para-ref" href="#origin"></a></h2>

<p>The idea for Tentuk came in January only as “hey plash, hey plash, how about a game where all the sound is human voice?”. I blame Kasamatsu Kouji, my vocal folds, and also my brain. I dropped the qualification that <em>all</em> audio must be voice-derived, because that'd take a lot of work that I don't want to spend on a “small” project (oh, who am I kidding&hellip;). The idea mingled a bit with ixili (Nahuatl for "to pierce"), a short-lived project I was co-opted to and spearheaded during the summer of 2013, which held Mesoamerican inspiration. Tentuk takes no immediate real-world cultural inspiration except some Middle Eastern clothing and architectural styles. I don't know how strongly that will come out in the end, and I expect a ton more to seep in that will make no sense.</p>

<p>My vocal experiments of late have leaned towards creatures &mdash; experiments I've wanted to play with and manipulate, but with my pre-occupation on Onsang, I haven't had the time. I should be able to manage a rich soundscape through that and my escapades in SunVox. This will be the first time I've used my voice for a project, and I hope to have voiced dialogue, but I won't commit to that unless I can manipulate my voice to convincingly sound like different people of any gender. I suspect this isn't possible, so I will likely apply spoken language only sparsely. It's possible I'll be able to get away with it through some mechanical means, like the characters of the world not having identifiable genders, and using non-human forms of speech&hellip; or something. I dunno, it's all very <em>theoretical</em> at this point.</p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid direct real-world appropriation, so the language(s) in the game will be constructed. I don't want to talk too much about the story until I've laid the blueprints, but the player character will initially not be able to understand the language of the first people they meet. Analytic players, on the other hand&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="week-1" class="separator">Week 1<a class="para-ref" href="#week-1"></a></h2>

<p>This first week (starting February 2), I explored technical possibilities and made some decisions on the game world. Immediately thereafter, I got swept up in Blender, exploring the feasibility of using it for all of the props and scene layouts. I think I'm firmly in that seat now, whether it turns out to be a detriment or not. The complete script-ability of Blender gives it a lot of potential, and I think I've made an <em>interesting</em> decision, nevertheless.</p>

<p>The majority of this time was spent coding the toolchain, working out the scene configuration, and figuring out how to get what I wanted with the projection. It took a lot of tweaking and prodding to get passable shadows and clean, pixel-perfect axonometric lines. I was undecided on the projection until today: front-facing with Y as depth. This makes the shadowing a little trickier, but makes simple model texturing and shading a lot easier. I have yet to white-box a test scene, so I'm still uncertain whether a slight horizontal rotation (10° or so) is desirable.</p>

<p>To get an idea of what the projection will look like and feel like mechanically, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbrothers:_Sword_%26_Sworcery_EP" target="_blank">Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</a>. I guess this sort-of tagged along with ixili, which was straight-up copying the art style of S&amp;S. I don't want to do that with Tentuk, and I learned with ixili that pixel-accurate animation in 3D is really tricky. My initial desire is to use few colors and few shapes for the art style, as that will hopefully be within my poor artistic capacities. Pixel art is probably not a reasonable style for my desired timeline, and it will be easier on my psyche to go rough, even if I end up using a pixel art edge. Scene backdrops will be painted, with background props baked in. The majority of props should be fully capable 3D models so that they can be used in different orientations. It's more work individually, but it'll hopefully pay off through reuse.</p>

<p>As of writing, the toolchain has mocked-up backdrop baking and individual prop rendering, with separation of the backdrop shadow and prop-to-prop shadowing baked in with the prop (I could make better sense of this if I weren't so tired). I've not worked with any scene backdrops yet. That's on the agenda for next week, along with packing prop imagery and rendering a scene in-game. If all goes well, I will have a test scene up and running by the end of the week. If there is time, and I suspect there won't be, I'm going to start playing around with audio.</p>

<h2 id="timelapsing" class="separator">Timelapsing<a class="para-ref" href="#timelapsing"></a></h2>

<p>Starting next week, I will post a dev timelapse with the weekly journal. I had this idea only a few days ago, so there's barely any recorded data, which is why I'm holding off until next week. If I manage to finish the game in 7 weeks (the target deadline, ugh), the recorded data should run about 100,032 frames and weigh around 20GB (half of my initial estimate, woo!), projecting from 52.1 hours this week (yes, very scientific).</p>

<h2 id="scheduling" class="separator">Scheduling<a class="para-ref" href="#scheduling"></a></h2>

<p>It turns out game development is really hard, and really fun. Ever done a gamejam? Perhaps Ludum Dare? This week was like Ludum Dare for me, but a whole 5.3 days long. Just so you understand the gravity of that, I was awake for 37 hours <a href="/dev/ludum-dare-30-postmortem-onomo/" target="_blank">last time</a>. I developed a daily schedule during January, and it has proven very difficult to hold this week. I completely lose track of time and am detrimentally affected by deviation from the schedule &mdash; which is meant to keep my diet rigid, exercise consistent, and rhythm flowing.</p>

<p>It proved to be very beneficial during January, when I was working on Hord &amp; Onsang. I think it's because that work always felt like drudgery, even when it was interesting or challenging. I was always aware of time because my mind wasn't engaged or focused. It's so bizarre to see the shift in time perception while my efficiency seems unchanged. I'm still unsure if it's because I'm excited to be trekking new ground, or if it's because I've just been really slow. Maybe I'll have a better idea when I'm not so darn tired.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>I've been working exclusively on <a href="https://github.com/komiga/hord" target="_blank">Hord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Onsang" target="_blank">Onsang</a> this month. These projects are roughly designed in the same way as the rest of my 2009&ndash;2014 projects are (in which they occupy only 2013&ndash;2014). I only really grew into thoughtful programming in 2009, as I started using C++, but this isn't to say the projects of that period are <em>well designed</em>. Years of working in the same style doesn't show one much; there's nothing to contrast against, and fools like myself generally don't seek out alternative approaches unless they see the existing problems. The naivety of a budding programmer certainly offers no help.</p>

<p>Luckily, I've had a couple of big contrasting designs &amp; methodologies since 2014. Most of this was digesting material from talks, blogs, &amp; papers, and, thankfully, rational thinking. I wasn't especially attached to my approaches, but that alone wouldn't have been enough to force me to work &amp; think differently. It took a willingness to explore, even if that meant leaving behind a lot of work I'd already done. I owe much to bitsquid, whose <a href="http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> make up the majority of the material. All of this shed light on the issues I didn't know I had &mdash; issues that drive deeper than the code itself.</p>

<p>The executive initiative came with <a href="https://github.com/komiga/togo" target="_blank">togo</a> near the end of June. At the beginning, I was taking a dive into the deep end on theory alone, without having experienced the values and intricacies of a data-oriented design, with a semantic and syntactic style far different from my existing projects. I began to appreciate it more over time, especially as I kept going back to tinker on Hord &amp; Onsang. The efficiency of compilation and editing alone had sold me (and, somewhat unsurprisingly, the systematic structure I valued), especially in comparison to my earlier projects. Compiling togo is faster than compiling my <em>smaller</em> projects by factors of 3 to 7. Even though the majority of my projects are relatively small (including togo), these factors <em>are</em> significant.</p>

<p>It probably goes without saying, but even a minor delay between editing and execution is a major hindrance to iteration and testing &mdash; the less friction, the better. An important factor of togo is that it does not depend on other projects with poor design, whereas most of the others <em>do</em>. In header libraries like duct++ and AM‽, any change requires all of its dependers to be recompiled! This compounding is what makes them worse, even if they were individually as fast to compile as togo.</p>

<p>So, going back to Hord and Onsang, where my mistake was made&hellip; Apart from simply being excruciatingly slow to compile, the over-reliance on what I'd call ‘structural formalism’ has doomed them (Hord directly, and Onsang as an instigating bystander). Being a bookend of sorts to my designs up to 2013, I had (unfortunately) decided Hord needed to be strongly specified and very strict. There's some value in this, in that I was determined to make sure there were no discrepancies and everything was sufficiently documented, but in the end none of that mattered, and it only served to harm the end purpose of Onsang.</p>

<p>This mode of thinking tended towards premature optimization and, more importantly, eternal black holes of design. This mode of thinking lead to the ghastly inventions of <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ceformat" target="_blank">ceformat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/komiga/murk" target="_blank">murk</a>, and duct++'s Gnarly Report (<em>it's literally right there in the name!</em>), all of which I immensely regret. This mode of thinking lead to “in theory this should work; can't wait to try it out!” (which I was saying for two self-destructive years) instead of “in practice, this works, because it's <em>actually running right there in the terminal</em>” (i.e., functionality, which is where all of that effort on formalism should have been directed).</p>

<p>The inception that lead to this was the idea that I could learn about tech that I'd not seriously engaged before. How in the world did that lead to formalism? I think it comes down to a few things (though, as always, there's a whole swamp of bile responsible): a desire for systemic structure that I had ever since I started using C++, some kind of semantic contract to back it up, and <em>the Googlemachine</em>. You see, the Googlemachine decided in August 2012 that my GitHub profile met some obscure criteria, and I had received a pre-pre-interview solicitation from one of their recruiters. I didn't make the cut, and the recruiter decided to mention they'd come back to it two years later. Here the motions begin.</p>

<p>They wanted me for the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, which primarily prides low-level knowledge of *nix, networking, and That Monster, Big Data. Naturally, I had none of this, but I was eager to learn, so I decided to finally remake my log keeper (which is essentially a UI wrapped around a tree of spreadsheets) in January 2013 and learn along the way. Networking had to be part of that, so Hord was designed with messaging and distributed data storage. All of that is now gone. One by one, these little bits I tacked on to “learn something” fell to the wayside, as the project was completely ungrowing otherwise. Onsang didn't spawn until October 2013, and it was nowhere near being functionally representative of <em>actual software you interact with</em> until July 2014 (and even then, you couldn't do anything). What a disaster!</p>

<p>I'm sad to say I thought I could still get something out of it this month. I did, in a testament to my willpower (yay, I can do things in spite of a terrific adversary!), but it's not good enough. I can finally interact with the data through Onsang, and I could do a little more work and have effectively the same degree of functionality I have in my old log keeper (which I still use), but after two years, I simply can't ignore the fact that this has been a monumental disaster. Why should I willingly continue to suffer under these projects? They slow me down and <em>keep</em> me down. The efficiency isn't even the problem, it's the poisonous psychological detriment that results from them. Working with or on Hord, or even thinking about doing so, <em>literally made me depressed</em>. And I don't mean depressed as in “boo-hoo, they stole my cookie”, I mean <em>depressed in that I was unable to do anything productive or be happy doing anything else</em>.</p>

<p>I don't think I ever fully articulated or understood why, but now I know: it's simply because Hord is the worst thing I have created ever since I started programming. I mean that sincerely. Even with all of the issues I could find in my ancient projects and their poor (finger quotes) quality, almost nothing comes to mind that has inflicted more damage than Hord to my psyche and my growth as a programmer, as a creative person, and as a human.</p>

<p>So I'm done. I'm throwing them away. Hord and Onsang will forever remind me that mistakes are costly and that my foresight is (or hopefully was) unreasonable. In three days, as I decided <a target="_blank" href="/self/retrospective/2014/">earlier this month</a>, I will go back to game development. I will make a short game using my voice for sound effects and continue development on togo. I'd like the game to be done by the end of March at the latest, and I'm going to shift my education slot from French to drawing, which has been delayed for far too long.</p>

<p>The original plan was to sideline Onsang and only work on it as needed, with game projects being primary. I'm almost happy with where it came and even the thesis that it presents in functionality, but not with the crap I had to put up with to get it there, and the crap I still have to put up with to expand it. When I inevitably re-approach Onsang, it will be to tear it down and start anew. The gravest justification for the mistake of formalism was that it mattered to others, or that it had more value as a result, when in reality I was (and am) the only person who would ever use the software. I designed Hord for outsiders <em>who never existed</em>, and latched onto it as a way of teaching myself new avenues, when it only crippled the software. It should be directed by <em>functionality</em>, not formalism, and it should be designed <em>for itself</em>, not for some ulterior purpose. This is what I take away from the biggest mistake I have made &amp; remade &amp; remade &amp; remade since 2013.</p>

<p>This means I have to give up the dream of Onsang, at least for the foreseeable future. Is that so bad? In reality, no, because I can live healthily just as all other humans do by using their brains, and I don't <em>need</em> the data &amp; statistics it would provide, even if I <em>really</em> want it. There is absolutely no way it would have reached the point of functionality I desire without another year of hard work &mdash; or worse. Hard work that would have been wasted, and surely by that time I would be utterly disgusted and declare its banishment from the universe, as I am pre-emptively doing now in the interest of myself. That or I would have redesigned it from the inside-out, which I will be doing in the future anyways! Good riddance.</p>

<p>I have no words.</p>

<p>&hellip; Okay, I have <em>some</em> words.</p>

<p>First, an overview. My software repackaging contract finally ended on May 31, after 3 years and 5 months. I sacked <a href="https://github.com/komiga/murk" target="_blank">murk</a> and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Cacophony" target="_blank">Cacophony</a>. I significantly advanced the whole of <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Beard" target="_blank">Beard</a> (most notably, focus handling). I moved <a href="https://github.com/komiga/am" target="_blank">AM‽</a>'s linear operators out-of-class and restructured the hash interface. I went through two command schemes in <a href="https://github.com/komiga/hord" target="_blank">Hord</a>, developed an initial table storage model, and reworked the fundamental object structure. I broke Clang at least three times and found an error in libc++. I started <a href="https://github.com/komiga/togo" target="_blank">togo</a> on June 22. I playtested the Linux port of Antichamber and reported <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vqZq60K.jpg" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IQjwJMr.jpg" target="_blank">bugs</a> in the Linux version of Among the Sleep.</p>

<p>I lived with my brother in Berkeley, California from August 2 to October 31 (90 days). While there, I made <a href="http://komiga.com/#onomo" target="_blank">Onomo</a> for Ludum Dare 30, had a battery fully discharge into my arm over 24 hours, attended GameDevDrinkUp in San Francisco (twice), attended QGCon, and failed to acquire employment. I observed that several factors, especially environment and social space, are dwarfed by discipline and motivation when it comes to <em>doing</em>. My discipline and motivation were largely not positively affected by the (little) improvement of these factors, and my continued lack of them was as ruinous as ever. There is undoubtedly a strength in harmony between environmental &amp; contextual factors and discipline &amp; motivation, and I've found that the positive presence of one side does not necessarily bring about the same to the other.</p>

<p>Back in Ohio, nothing of much note occurred beyond my attendance to the Texts and Contexts Conference in Columbus. Oh, and a <em>copious</em> display of privilege during the holidays. We are afforded too much.</p>

<p>That may <em>seem</em> like a lot, but it still doesn't <em>feel</em> like it, even when I write it all out. I was distraught between the high points at best, and rarely determined enough to do anything consistently.</p>

<p>As for the interests jotted out in my <a href="/self/retrospective/2013/" target="_blank">post for 2013</a>, none have been thoroughly advanced. I've done very little with SuperCollider, and I didn't learn any music theory. I forget the exact causes, but it's most likely from the lack of motivation and, in the latter case, because I had just begun developing togo.</p>

<p>I feel most of the year was wasted, despite having spent the largest amount of time on projects since 2011. My greatest difficulty is <em>applying</em> what I know about&hellip; well, everything. Design and execution, primarily. Premature optimization, eternal black holes of design, unbridled habits. I know these mechanics on a deep level, but I don't utilize the knowledge to prevent them. At least I now know (quantitatively <em>and</em> practically) where the wasteful hot spots are in the gamut of my behaviors.</p>

<p>My immediate goals for 2015 are: 1. eradicating waste, 2. improving discipline (especially as motivation has proven unreliable), and 3. developing a game. I will construct a weekly schedule and test variations as I push <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Onsang" target="_blank">Onsang</a> to the point of reasonable usability. By either that point or the end of January, I will allot time towards togo and a game.</p>

<p>With all of this in hand, the only deciding factor in my success is willpower. Given my abusive, hyper-exhaustive approach to design, the best motto for me is Just Do It™.</p>

<p>So I will.</p>

<h2 id="data" class="separator">Data<a class="para-ref" href="#data"></a></h2>

<p>I tracked a total of 8753.3 hours in 2014 with 16177 entries (1827 greater than in 2013). 6.7 hours were (probably) gobbled up by micro discontinuities and weird software. On a bright note, that's only half the time lost during 2013!</p>

<p>One speculative lesson in my 3 years, 9 months, and 28 days of time tracking is that the mere amount of time you sleep has no effect on productivity (provided it is at least healthy). Proper segmenting does, for sure, but there are tougher nuts to crack.</p>

	<li id="fn-fun-fact">Fun fact: my dream for Onsang endows it with tracking and automatic statistics much deeper than herein. For example: scheduling, vital signs, nutrition, efficiency determinations by sleep and food intake, financing/budgeting, media, and on and on. I already spot-check pulse rate, temperature, S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and weight; I track development by project, work by task, exercise, bio waste, media, and food intake down to the ingredient, volume, and methods of preparation &amp; cooking. Among other things. The details about these segments of time are syntactically coherent and governed by systems that mostly exist only within my head. All I need to do is move the structural and quantitative aspects out of my head and into software. Once Onsang is <em>fully operational</em>, I will have a wealth of supportive information at my fingertips, at a maintenance cost far below its current value.</li>

<strong><big>Frame: railyard.</big></strong>

<p>Piles of strewn railroad ties and a confusing layout of railways pierce the foggy fringes of the yard. The ground is covered in large, dark gray gravel, illuminated by several bright, elevated lights and blinking orange signal lights along the center track. This lighting and the blowing wind render strange shadows from flapping tarps. A slow, punctuating metallic creak sets the background.</p>

<p>Amer is leaning against a stack of rail segments, holding his hoodie over-shoulder, looking at the ground. He is Middle Eastern and stands 182cm, with muted blue-and-gold eyes. His face is lightly tanned, narrow, and textured by thin black stubble along his jaw, chin, and around his lips, with a sharp jawline, long nose, and short black hair. He is wearing a long, dark gray overshirt and dark khaki pants. An empty bottle sits next to him.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The rear of a train slowly rolls into the center of the railyard, butted by a caboose, followed by an indiscernible number of cars. The caboose's coat is dark blue with a red stripe running horizontally across the body. White lettering above the red stripe reads “RCR” and “1104”.</p>

<p>The train creaks to a halt and a door opens at the rear of the caboose.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: apartment.</big></strong>

<p>The science balloon™ is lying on the ground with little pockets of helium here and there. The room is lit in a natural sunny hue by a lamp next to the couch. Muffled music of various dispositions and fake television laughter from about the building are melded together into a weird neo-genre Amer calls “avant moderne”. (Merla often chastises him for his French.)</p>

<p>Merla is sitting on the couch and tapping away at her cell. She is wearing a loose, hip-length heather gray cotton T-shirt emblazoned blue-on-white with “But have you tried <em class="f-serif">The Internet?</em> No? <u><em class="f-serif">Don't!</em></u>”, and form-fitting pink-on-white striped hipster panties. Her damp, dark brown, shoulder-length hair is pulled around and brushing her right shoulder in a messy bunch of strands. Her light green eyes reflect a small bluish white rectangle from her cell screen.</p>

<p>She locks her cell, places it on the table next to the couch, and begins to ponder the short, sad life of the science balloon™. Balloons should have a union, she sleepily decides, to protect their right to a somewhat longer (though possibly sadder) life as uniquely peculiar party decorations. Mr. Duckster squeak-quacks in agreement, <em>completely</em> of his own volition.</p>

<p><em>*yaaaawn*</em></p>

<p>Merla turns off the lamp.</p>

<p>Her headache has gone down somewhat since the shower, but it's still throbbing rather painfully. She grabs a blanket from the other side of the couch, poofs up a pillow, and attempts to sleep. On the couch. Y'know, because couches have <em>exceptional</em> restorative powers.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Her breathing slows and deepens.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: convenience store.</big></strong>

<p>“QUICK MART” in bold, white Arial (&hellip;yep!) crowns the front of the building. A neon sign on the window reads “24/7”. Low pop music and the hum of refrigerators play in the background. A streetlight illuminates a boring swath of the sidewalk outside the store. Its marginally-perceptible, high-frequency flicker suggests a grating buzz. A thick fog envelops the quiet vicinity, though a railroad-crossing sign is visible just beyond the streetlight.</p>

<p>A young woman is sitting on a hard, wooden stool behind the counter, quietly reading with hazel eyes from near the end of a red, worn hardback book, which she is holding on her lap. She is wearing black, narrow-frame glasses, thin black cotton sweatpants, and a heather gray, tight-fitting hoodie zipped to brow-level, emblazoned with “<strong>R</strong>&vellip;<strong>U</strong>” in a red-on-white collegiate font. She is short and fit, with light skin, messy chin-length brown hair, and bowed eyebrow-level bangs.</p>

<p>The young woman turns a page in the red book.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The door bell chimes as the door opens. An old man walks in wearing a dark green beanie, a dirty, patched light brown jacket, and two or so layers of pants, the top being dulled dark blue polyester windbreakers. He is muttering something or other and moving with a bit of a jitter. The door bell chimes as the door closes.</p>

<p>The young woman looks up at the muttering old man and analyzes his threat level, considering different aspects of his figure and behavior.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>She keeps a glancing eye on the unlikely patron and returns to the red book as the muttering old man looks around and grumbles at random items on the shelves.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The door bell chimes as the door opens. The muttering old man stumbles through the door, pushing it with the left side of his body. The door bell chimes as the door closes.</p>

<p>The young woman leans slightly forward and looks over the counter to examine the area where the muttering old man walked and the door he touched.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>She sits back and pushes up her glasses before returning to the red book.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A short-haired white cat with blue eyes and a misshapen right ear hops up to the young woman's lap. She raises the red book to eyebrow-level in front of her, still reading as the purring white cat rubs its cheeks against her elbows. White lettering along the spine of the red book reads:</p>

<div class="rotate-90 generic-center-text f-serif" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em;">
	<p style="line-height: 0.9em;"><span class="f-style-sc" style="text-align: right;">&mdash; <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4em;">Le</span>s &mdash;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 120%; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">P<span class="f-style-sc">assages</span></span></p>
</div>

<p>The young woman closes the red book.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: restaurant.</big></strong>

<p>Samantha and Dezora are sitting at a dining table. Apart from the two, the place is vacant. Samantha stirring ice in her cup and the whirr of the air conditioning are all to hear.</p>

<p>Samantha's curly highlighted brown hair is wrangled into a small, poofy tail. She is African-European and about 169cm tall, with smooth, medium brown complexion. Her face is round and narrows towards her chin, with dashed freckles across her nose and beneath her brown eyes. She is wearing a long ochre sweater that extends to her hips, a wide-pleated black-on-white polka dot skirt extending to just cover her knees, and thin, thigh-high black socks under black low-top sneakers with white laces. A colored penguin pendant is strung around her neck by a thin, silver metal chain. A gray-and-white wide-striped scarf is on the seat to her left.</p>

<p>Dezora is sitting to the right of Samantha, peering down and drawing on a sketchbook on her lap. She is distinctly Asian and around 175cm tall, with soft round cheeks, dark brown eyes, and chin-level black hair. A small brown mole sits next to her left eye, sometimes visible under the hair laid across the mid of her forehead to her left ear. The hair on the front-right and right side of her face comes down and back, stopping just past the jawline, making a curved, Λ-shaped section of forehead visible above her right eye. Some of her hair strays in other directions towards the back of her head, but the majority is folded up &amp; down and pinned at the back, making a narrow loop. She is  wearing a loose, low-cut, black tank top over a thick teal camisole, black cropped jeans, teal-and-red diamond on mid-gray shin-high socks, and red, paint-speckled, short-top Converse with teal laces. A small silver earing pierces her left earlobe.</p>

<p>“How's Merla?” inquires Dezora.</p>

<p>Samantha locks her phone and slides it away to arm's length.</p>

<p>“No good. She just said she's gonna try to sleep it off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, too bad.”</p>

<p>“Hey, do you remember that junior girl back in high-school who went completely psychotic during gym class?” (rubbing eyes).</p>

<p>“&hellip; Sorta-kinda. Why?” (looking up from from her sketchbook).</p>

<p>“I dunno. The subway thing reminded of someone or something. I think it was her” (placing her elbows on the table and looking to Dezora).</p>

<p>“I don't remember it that well.”</p>

<p>“It's eerie.. something familiar. &hellip; Merla would have a phrase for this sense” (looking down, holding &amp; stretching her neck)</p>

<p>“Déjà vu” (now looking out the front windows).</p>

<p>“Aaaai guess.”</p>

<p>“No no, I mean I'm <em>having</em> déjà vu.”</p>

<p>Dezora places her sketchbook and drawing implements on the table and hastily slide-hops out the right side. She quickly walks out the front door and makes a few steps before crouching and holding out her hand to something dark &amp; partially obscured by reflected light from the windows.</p>

<p>Samantha slides out the left side of the table and walks out to see what Dezora is doing.</p>

<p>Dezora is holding her left hand out to a short-haired black cat with green eyes, who is sniffing her fingers. Dezora scratches the black cat's head and cheeks, but it's still interested in sniffing.</p>

<p>“Look Sam, I found a kitty.”</p>

<p>“Awww” (squatting to reach the black cat with her right arm).</p>

<p>The black cat had begun to rub against Dezora's hand, but is now more interested in sniffing Samantha's hand. And her shoes. And her socks. And her skirt.</p>

<p>“He's onto you, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Uh-oh.”</p>

<p>“Whoa, check out his ear.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that's weird.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The black cat has accepted the existence of Samantha and is now weaving between Dezora's hands and Samantha's legs.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“What happened to your ear, little guy?”</p>

<p>The black cat stands still between the two and looks at Dezora, tail still wagging. The black cat meows at her, fast-walks across the street, and turns down an alley.</p>

<p>“Uhh, sorry I asked?”</p>

<p>“Ouch. So he was your déjà vu?”</p>

<p>“Yah. He seems so familiar, but I can't remember having seen any black cats around the city before.”</p>

<p>“That makes two of us.”</p>

<p>“Must be their natural ninjutsu talents. Next time, <em>you</em> get to ask about his ear.”</p>

<p>“I think he liked me better anyway.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“&hellip; I will <em>never</em> get used to the fog in this city.”</p>

<p>A thick fog has crept around the restaurant, obscuring the sidewalks across the street, with streetlights forming tinted blobs in the fog, but not improving the visibility.</p>

<p>“Such is the nature of RAVENHALLOW, DREAD LAND OF THE FOG MONSTERS!” (in a standing squat with claw-up hands and an aghast expression to suggest suspense).</p>

<p>Samantha laughs at Dezora.</p>

<p>“AND RAVENS!”</p>

<p>“C'mon inside before the fog monsters swallow you whole, adventurer Dez.”</p>

<p>“And.. <em>HALLOWS</em>!”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Dezora has returned to drawing in her previous position. Samantha is resting on her crossed arms on the table, watching Dezora work.</p>

<p>“This must be a world record for longest tea preparation time” jests Samantha.</p>

<p>“Maybe we've been forgotten” ponders Dezora.</p>

<p>“How many people are still here?”</p>

<p>“One or two. They do their training alone now.”</p>

<p>“I'm gonna see what's up.”</p>

<p>“Probably just forgot.”</p>

<p>Samantha walks over to the bar. No one present. Expected, seeing as Quiddlopolis is technically closed. She walks around to the kitchen door and peers through its small window.</p>

<p>“<em>Huh.</em>”</p>

<p>She walks into the kitchen. The door swings back and flaps against rubber stoppers. The kitchen is overtly metallic and floored with white tiles. There is an aproned Asian man to the far left on a cold metal stool, with his arms crossed on the polished metal counter. He is resting comfortably against his left arm, with his head somewhat upright. Short-sleeved white T-shirt, small cap, short black hair &mdash; a cook. On the stove to the right of the aproned man, calm steam rises from a pot heated by a gentle blue flame.</p>

<p>Samantha steps to the pot. <em>Only boiling water.</em> A hand touches her right shoulder. She jumps in surprise, reaches her right hand to her chest, and quickly turns around.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;”</p>

<p>No one is there. Her eyes jump around the room as she breathes sharply.</p>

<p>“<em>You're imagining it, Sam&hellip; it's just your imagination.</em>”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>She looks at the aproned man.</p>

<p>“'Oy.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“'Oooy”, this time poking him.</p>

<p>She waits and watches carefully for any shift of the aproned man's body.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Is he even breathing? She shakes his shoulder cautiously. His head tweaks to the left and his right arm falls off the table, limp.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh shit.</em>”</p>

<p>She feels for a pulse on his neck. <em>Fuck.</em> She runs out of the kitchen to fetch her cell.</p>

<p>Dialing EMS. Dezora looks at her, alarmed.</p>

<p>“State your emergency.”</p>

<p>“This guy isn't breathing I couldn't find a pulse I think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sam?”</p>

<p>Samantha looks over to De&mdash; <em>no one?</em> Paper with bold scrawl sits on the table.</p>

<p><small>“Ma'am?”</small></p>

<p><strong><em>SAMANTHA?</em></strong></p>

<p><small><small>“Where are you?”</small></small></p>

<p><strong>“WHERE ARE YOU?”</strong> screams a furious, disembodied male voice.</p>

<p><strong>“I WILL CALL THE POLICE IF YOU AREN'T BACK BY MORNING.”</strong></p>

<p>“THEN I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING!” cries Samantha.</p>

<p><strong>“JUST RETURN, okay, and I WILL let them GO!”</strong></p>

<p>“I'M NEVER COMING BACK!”</p>

<p><strong>“GOD DAMMIT, SAMANTHA!”</strong> (raucous rage and slamming through the earpiece).</p>

<p>Samantha shudders and closes her eyes.</p>

<p>Enveloping dead-line tone. The lights shatter and she free-falls into the darkness.</p>

<p><small>“Saaam.”</small></p>

<p><em>*sharp gasp and uprighting*</em></p>

<p>Samantha is sitting at a dining table. Dampened electronic music fills the background. Steam rises from teacups on the table. An aproned man holding a tray yawns and walks into the kitchen. <em>*flap <small>flap <small>flap</small></small>*</em>. And&hellip; <em>*giggling*?</em></p>

<p>“Samantha.”</p>

<p><em>Dez?</em></p>

<p>“&hellip; Huh?”</p>

<p>“You're drooling.”</p>

<p>Samantha wipes the drool off her left cheek with her sweater. The penguin pendant falls from her cheek. With a newly-awakened dizziness, she feels the impression it left on her cheek and stares blankly at the teacup in front of her.</p>

<p>“Were you dreaming?”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Samantha leans over to Dezora and hugs her waist, burying her face, sobbing.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: narrow alley.</big></strong>

<p>A large man in a white tuxedo is standing cross-armed in front of a nondescript door. His wide, large white face is textured by a full &amp; short dark brown beard; his dark brown hair bows over his forehead, just above his eyelashes, and trims across his ears, confusing his presumed image of muscle-for-hire with that of a &hellip; professor? Neon signs and paper lanterns across the streets give an amalgamation of ambient lighting. Occasional vehicles blink past the outlets of the alley. Pedestrians shuffle by the outlets with purpose in their step.</p>

<p>Amer is pacing in front of the tuxedoed man, who is watching him pace. Amer is holding up his right arm to his chin with his left arm. Amer is doing this to imply pondering.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Amer's pacing is slowly increasing in speed.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The tuxedoed man extends his right arm, holds his sleeve in place with his left, and reads the time on his large silver watch. <em>03:42.</em></p>

<p>“Well?” he asks, sounding somewhat bothered.</p>

<p>“I can't remember!” Amer exclaims in annoyance, throwing his arms up.</p>

<p>“That has been established.”</p>

<p>“Have I ever mentioned how unusually intellectual you are for a door guard?”</p>

<p>“I'm not a door guard, but no, you have never complimented me.”</p>

<p>“It's not a compliment &mdash; who would want that in a <em>bouncer</em>?”</p>

<p>“Those who have no interest in unreliable people such as yourself.”</p>

<p>“You're supposed to be big and dumb and strong!” Amer exclaims, moving his arms in tandem visual suggestion.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: apartment.</big></strong>

<p>Dark &amp; cozy, but punctuated by muddied Zimmerian film music and bassy thuds. A sliver of moonlight seeps beneath curtains opposite the couch of exceptional restorative powers, where Merla is sleeping. Her breathing is gentle and quiet. Various blue, red, and green LEDs flicker and pierce the vision. Merla's cell is sitting on the table next to the couch.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>An unseen hand turns on and unlocks Merla's cell. <em>02:04</em>.</p>

<p>The unseen hand taps to the messaging app.</p>

<ul>
	<li>15:01 &ndash; You &ndash; “&vellip; come’ and ‘the witch demands you’ and a bunch of nonsense”</li>
	<li>15:01 &ndash; You &ndash; “It's spooky”</li>
	<li>15:02 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Wow that dude was definitely on something”</li>
	<li>15:03 &ndash; You &ndash; “Yeah”</li>
	<li>15:03 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Now I don't wanna go anywhere”</li>
	<li>15:04 &ndash; You &ndash; “Right?”</li>

	<li>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</li>

	<li>23:43 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “How are you feeling?”</li>
	<li>23:44 &ndash; You &ndash; “A little better”</li>
	<li>23:44 &ndash; You &ndash; “I'm gonna try to sleep it off”</li>
	<li>23:46 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Ok. Goodnight and good luck &hearts;”</li>
	<li>23:46 &ndash; You &ndash; “Night Sam”</li>
	<li>23:46 &ndash; You &ndash; “&hearts;”</li>
</ul>

<p>The unseen hand scrolls through the messages.</p>

<p>&darr; &darr; &darr;</p>

<ul>
	<li>11:30 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Do you know why you're t here?”</li>
	<li>11:32 &ndash; You &ndash; “What? I'm at home”</li>
	<li>11:32 &ndash; You &ndash; “What a strange question.”</li>
	<li>11:33 &ndash; You &ndash; “Saaamm... Where's your brain?”</li>
	<li>11:34 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Oops.. uhhh I don't even know”</li>
	<li>11:36 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Sleepy Sam just woke up”</li>
	<li>11:37 &ndash; You &ndash; “Amer says hi ‘with a capital H because you're ... Healthy’”</li>
	<li>11:38 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Hi Amer with a capital A because you're Asinine”</li>
	<li>11:42 &ndash; You &ndash; “No comeback. I don't think he was going anywhere with that”</li>
	<li>11:42 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Of course not. Tell him Elena says the stuff for the thing dun work”</li>
	<li>11:43 &ndash; You &ndash; “He said ‘try harder’”</li>

	<li>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</li>

	<li>14:54 &ndash; You &ndash; “Did you hear about that guy who freaked out on the subway?”</li>
	<li>14:54 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “No. What happened?”</li>
	<li>14:55 &ndash; You &ndash; “He was screaming and hitting people. The police are &vellip;”</li>
</ul>

<p>The unseen hand returns to the initial position.</p>

<p>&uarr; &uarr; &uarr;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Merla's cell turns off.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: narrow alley.</big></strong>

<p>Amer stops pacing and turns to face the tuxedoed man.</p>

<p>The tuxedoed man looks at him expectantly.</p>

<p>“What time is it?”</p>

<p>The tuxedoed man extends his arm, holds his sleeve in place, and checks the time on his large silver watch.</p>

<p>“03:59. Don't you have a phone?”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Amer hands the tuxedoed man a bright green USB thumb drive. The tuxedoed man looks down at the drive, then back to Amer.</p>

<p>“Give that to the missus. I have better things to do.”</p>

<p>“That's not how it works.”</p>

<p>Amer starts walking quickly to the left side of the alley.</p>

<p>“Don't care!” exclaims Amer, raising &amp; waving a hand in dismissal. “You're smart, do it yourself!”</p>

<p>The tuxedoed man watches Amer cross the left corner out of the alley. Illuminated, unimaginative signage across the street reads “MASSAGES”. The muffled sounds of a street musician's erhu and a distant electronic beat are swirled together.</p>

<p>The tuxedoed man sits on an upturned plastic crate and rotates the thumb drive in his hand. Worn print on the nondescript door behind him reads “721”. The nondescript door is now the numbered door.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A short-haired white cat with blue eyes, a misshapen right ear, and a somewhat yellow-stained &amp; matted coat of fur walks in front of the tuxedoed man from the right side of the alley, stops, and looks at the tuxedoed man. The tuxedoed man looks at the white cat and holds out his hand, making clicking sounds with his tongue.</p>

<p>“Here kitty. &hellip; C'mere.”</p>

<p>The white cat turns and quickly walks around the left corner out of the alley.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: restaurant.</big></strong>

<p>Samantha is resting her head against the shoulder of Dezora, who is holding her near. She wears a sad but empty expression, with reflective channels streaking down from her eyes.</p>

<p>“That place is an age and world away; they don't know who you are or where” says Dezora, soothingly.</p>

<p>“Doesn't make any difference.”</p>

<p>“We won't let anything happen. You're safe, Sam.”</p>

<p>“If it were that simple, if I could wish it away, I would have already done it” she chokes, her eyes welling up.</p>

<p>Dezora turns and hugs her. She grasps Dezora and cries.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: apartment.</big></strong>

<p>The weekend ambiance of dogs' barking, fake television laughter, and muffled music has been replaced by the dull hum of the refrigerator and the white noise of indiscernible things &amp; non-things.</p>

<p>Soft morning light bleeds through the curtains opposite the couch of exceptional restorative powers, where Merla is laying on her back in some state of sleep. Her breathing is deep and somewhat punctuated by smaller breaths. She groans and briefly shifts to face the back of the couch before returning to her original position. Her right knee raises and her left arm forms a raised ridge on her blanket down to her waist. She gently bites her lower lip; it rolls out from under her incisors as she gasps sharply.</p>

<p class="generic-center-text">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Merla sits upright and slowly rolls her head in a circle to test the effects of the headache. She raises her arms in a half-yawn half-victory cry.</p>

<p>“Yeeush!”</p>

<p>She stands up from the couch of <em>exceptional</em> restorative powers and stretches her arms, shoulders, and torso. Her thin, light-skinned French figure is around 164cm tall, with smooth, bare legs and slender arms.</p>

<p>She notices the poor science balloon™ under her foot as she reaches her arms to the floor. She picks up the science balloon™ and deposits it in the garbage bin next to the refrigerator.</p>

<p>She walks back to the couch of exceptional restorative powers and picks up her cell from the table. <em>07:22.</em> 4 unread messages.</p>

<ul>
	<li>02:16 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Scrumptious ~”</li>
	<li>02:23 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Amer came”</li>
	<li>02:24 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “Arriveeddd*”</li>
	<li>03:01 &ndash; <strong>Sam</strong> &ndash; “We saved you some. Call me when you're up.”</li>
</ul>

<p>She rubs her face and <em>*yawns*</em>. She walks into the bathroom and turns on the faucet.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>She loosely gathers up her hair to the back of her head and holds it together with a hair tie. She shifts a section across the top of her head to the left, pins it in place, and fiddles with fringes at the sides. Spindles jut out at the tie, and small, loose sidelocks sit above her soft jawline.</p>

<p>She swishes water in her mouth, spits it out, turns off the light in the bathroom, and walks past the couch of exceptional restorative powers to the bedroom. She shivers, looks around for a moment, and flings her T-shirt off. Her ribs are somewhat bony, with goose bumps all over, and perky, unsupported B-cup breasts. Her form is slim; her abdomen raises slightly just below her ribs and forms a raised ridge down the center to her pelvis, dually dipping along her innie navel. She jumps into a pair of black cotton sweatpants, fits into a black bra, slides a white camisole over her head, and raises her arms into a thin heather light blue zip-up sweater.</p>

<p>She walks out to the refrigerator, takes a cup from the counter with her left hand, and fills it up from the water dispenser on the refrigerator. It takes 11 seconds to dispense 350ml into the cup. She takes a draught and opens the refrigerator door with her right hand.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: small room.</big></strong>

<p>The walls and ceiling of the room are gray and padded. The floor is black and dull. There is an opaque, reflective window to the left. Florescent lights flicker above a cold, thick metal table bolted to the floor. A disheveled young man is sitting on a cold metal chair, handcuffed to a loop in the table. His black hair is short and his skin is a medium-dark brown; he is possibly of South American descent. He is muttering incomprehensibly, shivering, gazing downward, with tremors contorting his face.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A door suddenly opens to the left and a low heel clicks into the room. The disheveled man gasps and lowers his head to his cuffed hands, much too afraid to turn to the intruder. The door creaks shut with a click-thud.</p>

<p>A tall, broad-shouldered Asian woman steps out of the shadow. She is wearing a black suit, with black hair bunched up at the back of her head by a black plastic clip. The top button of her white shirt is unfastened. She places a small paper folder on the table and side-steps into a metal chair opposite the disheveled man. She postures upright, opens the folder, and examines the first two papers within it.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“Do you know why you are here?” she asks, still examining the papers.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>She looks up at the disheveled man. He is still.</p>

<p>“Do you know <em>what</em> you are?”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“<small><small>koome&hellip; nihis&hellip; nih&hellip; naaih&hellip; nnNight&hellip;</small></small> <small>Night&hellip; is <small>come.</small></small> <small><small>she&hellip; is</small> come.</small> <small>Night is come. <small>it&hellip; is&hellip;</small></small> Night <small>is come.</small> <small>Night</small> is come. <small><small>&hellip; come</small> come &hellip; Night is <small>come.</small>&hellip; <small>nnnight is &hellip; come</small> come is</small> <strong>night</strong>.”</p>

<p>The disheveled man suddenly lurches forward and bites towards the broad-shouldered woman.</p>

<strong><big>Frame: wide alley.</big></strong>

<p>Towering buildings. Dogs barking in the distance, for a moment. An old man in dirty clothes and a dark green beanie teeters on sleep, slowly nodding back and forth, muttering something incomprehensible. A short-haired white cat with blue eyes and a misshapen right ear is crouched near a garbage bin, waiting for its prey.</p>

<p>The white cat looks 'round as a tall man lugging a large duffel bag emerges from a brightly-lit door, opposite the muttering old man. His long-haired, gruff figure casts a long shadow on the ground, and his baseball cap occludes his face with a dark visor. His left hand is buried in a pocket of his muted dark green trench coat. The duffel bag droops in its center. He stands for a moment outside the door as it swings shut.</p>

<p>The tall man tugs his cap down and walks out of the alley, disappearing around the corner.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A hand holding a bottle appears several stories up, opposite the muttering old man, and pours out some kind of liquid. It lands directly on the white cat, who was just moments ago waiting for the perfect time to strike an unknowing rodent. The now-berserk white cat frantically runs out of the alley, shaking its coat and legs along the way.</p>

<a href="/media/2014-09-04-ld30/onomo-title-screen.png" target="_blank"><img src="/media/2014-09-04-ld30/onomo-title-screen.png" class="generic-center" width="100%" style="display: block;" alt="Onomo title screen which, in post LD sickness retrospect, is TOTALLY OFF CENTER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa" title="Onomo title screen which, in post LD sickness retrospect, is TOTALLY OFF CENTER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa" /></a>

<p>I made a&hellip; <em><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542" target="_blank">thing</a></em> in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 30. This thing, named Onomo, resembles a game, but lacks a win state and any effective mechanics.</p>

<p>During development I recorded a <a href="https://youtu.be/xTSZ0Ae18Hg" target="_blank">time-lapse</a> that will hopefully be illustrative to the folk that want to see how jammers operate. There are certainly some hours missing as I forgot to start my script several times, but it's mostly all there.</p>

<p>Herein I go through the timeline of this jam from my perspective and talk about the development of Onomo.</p>


<h2 id="pre-jam" class="separator">Pre-jam<a class="para-ref" href="#pre-jam"></a></h2>

<p>I forgot Ludum Dare was happening this August and was only reminded of it by my brother before I flew to California, where I have now been living for a hair over a month.</p>

<p>My plan was to furnish <a href="https://github.com/komiga/togo" target="_blank">togo</a> with enough capability to be usable. This did not happen. I had a pre-existing deficit of willpower and inspiration that prevented progress. Despite this, I managed to fold 69.3 hours of staring into the engine over the two weeks before Ludum Dare, although productivity and system relevance only returned during the second week (considering time alone: 45.1 hours, 65% of the time spent working on the engine over those two weeks).</p>

<p>Realizing that was futile, I shifted to renovating my <a href="https://github.com/komiga/love-kernel" target="_blank">project kernel</a> for <a href="http://love2d.org" target="_blank">LÖVE</a> during the week of Ludum Dare. These 27.5 hours were spent on 71 commits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Upgrading to LÖVE 0.9.1.</li>
	<li>Upending some weird structures and extending existing systems.</li>
	<li>Moving to a module and system structure that works with automatic reloading.</li>
	<li>Refactoring utilities and making them more consistent.</li>
	<li>Adding support for <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lurker" target="_blank">lurker</a> (which was indispensable) and <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lovebird" target="_blank">lovebird</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous (and first) time I used LÖVE (and my kernel) was during Ludum Dare 26, which resulted in <a href="http://komiga.com/#prisma" target="_blank">Prisma</a>. LÖVE already proved to be valuable and easy to distribute for the desktop trio of OSes. Automatic module reloading made it extremely powerful and eliminated iteration delay. I don't want to work without automatic code reloading now.</p>

<p>Even if togo were usable, I would've been in porting hell or never even bothered to port (which would've been bad for publicity and unfortunate for fellow Ludum Darians not yet initiated into the dark cult of Linux). This was apparent to me at the time, but I 'spose it just wasn't enough motivation to switch to the kernel immediately. The week before Ludum Dare would've been better spent intimating with my media tools.</p>

<p>LÖVE continues to be a good choice for game jams, and I suspect I will use it for many future jams until togo topples it.</p>


<h2 id="development" class="separator">Development<a class="para-ref" href="#development"></a></h2>

<p>I had inceptions for three themes during the final round: <strong>Connected Worlds</strong> (the highest voted among all previous rounds), <strong>Lost in Space</strong> (my personal favorite), and <strong>Isolation</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Connected Worlds</strong> predictably won, and I ran to catch the 18:07 Millbrae-bound <a href="http://www.bart.gov/" target="_blank">BART</a> train. I worked out the platforming system and explored some mechanics in transit.</p>

<p>I met my brother in the city and we headed off to a meetup hosted by Apportable. There were few groups at the meetup, and we only stayed for 3 hours. In retrospect, as my motivation for visiting was primarily networking, it would've been better to stop by after the Compo had finished (the meetup included the Compo and the Jam, so there would've been 24 hours remaining once I completed my entry). Regardless, I don't work well on solo things around other people or in unfamiliar environments, so it was probably best that I didn't stay for any significant period of time <em>during</em> development.</p>

<p>Once we scuffled home through the crowded subways, I spent a decent while complaining that Lost in Space wasn't the theme. This involved making spacey whale-like sounds in SunVox, shifting through different degrees of slack-jawedness, and possibly some annoyed moaning. (I was <em>very</em> attached to my SPACE SEA idea.) I then (somewhat unintentionally) slept for 7.3 hours. This was the only time I slept throughout the Compo.</p>

<p>After waking, with truly stalwart discipline, I cast aside my attachment to Lost in Space and charged forward into the dark, ominous lands of Onomo.</p>

<p>The premise of Onomo came verbatim from the inception: two parallel universes (in representation), with otherworldly characters that the player can switch between. The characters were the first to be sketched, and the final top character is the closest to the original drawing; only the arms were removed. The original bottom character had four legs and was more like a mouth with appendages rather than a beetle-like thing (the final design).</p>

<p>Preliminary mechanics were very unoriginal: move objects around to effect change in the opposite world. The top character would've been slower and unable to jump, but could climb on top of things (butchered by removing its arms!). The bottom character could jump and move faster. I hadn't decided on using puzzles, but I had many ideas for mood. I thought the puzzles would turn out uninteresting, so I looked for ways to make the game interesting in an exploratory sense.</p>

<p><em>Hmm&hellip;</em> A lot of the changes to each world could be subtle instead of explicit, requiring the player to pay attention and connect non-trivial dots. This was more interesting to me, but I suspected most people would not have the patience. Considering both that Ludum Dare is a short-form game jam and my lack of artistic vigour, the anchor of aesthetic was possibly a misstep. Despite this, everything I did was valuable in that I was breaking new personal ground. It was the first time I built a platforming system, the first time I tried character animation, and the first time I crafted coherent music for a purpose.</p>

<p>I'm unsure when, but eventually I decided the characters would be able to swap positions. That definitely would've been useful for the platforming aspect (e.g., one part of a world would only be traversable by a certain character due to size), but I think I was still viewing that avenue as uninteresting. This feature didn't make it into the game, and it would've required some work on top of the existing monoliths to make the transition clean.</p>

<p>Without having decided what to really do about mechanics, I set about building the platforming system, world editor, and aesthetic. I wasn't granular with my time logging during the jam, so I've no exact numbers on how much time I spent on code vs. media, but the latter took surprisingly little, especially audio (judging by the time-lapse). I think I spent only a few hours in the final day creating the music, and a disproportionate amount of the time on art was spent unconstructively seeing what would happen with the tileset under certain blend modes. It felt like the monoliths (especially the large ones) took forever, but the time-lapse proves otherwise. (P.S. I used an actual script for the monoliths; they're probably legible enough for a linguistic adventurer to decipher.)</p>

<p>Speaking of monoliths,<sup><a href="#fn-monoliths">1</a></sup> they were a late final-day idea that initially had no purpose. I realized the lighting was going to be the driving force for the mood of Onomo, so I spent a lot of time toying with it. The monoliths came from wanting a lit world feature that would draw attention. Glowing glyphs were an obvious choice, and the idea to link them came even later in the day. It was fairly obvious at this point that I was not going to be able to fit in any concrete mechanics, so I just focused on making the world look consistent and slapped on (spoilers!) activation of linked monoliths by triggering their chimes together. That's the only thing you can do in Onomo.</p>

<p>Code-wise, I probably spent the most of my time tweaking the lighting and figuring out how to do character animation, character movement, and platforming (all of which I had never done in this form before). I included in-game world editing from the very beginning because I didn't want to have to convert or read data from a tile editor (which I hadn't scoped out beforehand). The in-game editor proved to be very useful and I think that they are generally a good idea. However, the save function was broken for far too long due to my ill-informed attempt to pre-optimize. I was attempting to avoid outputting rows that were empty, but I neglected that table length in Lua is zero if items are not continuous or have non-integer keys. The optimization was hardly even an optimization, and it wouldn't've mattered in the end since there were only a few rows of tiles in each world. Pre-optimization is the root of evil!</p>

<p>Another large mistake I made was not separating game controls from editor controls clearly enough. I changed the controls for the editor mode on the final day to absolve this issue, but I failed to adapt to them. This is probably the gravest misstep as the sudden change was the largest barrier to world building, which I had already been neglecting. Also, since the monoliths were a late idea, I was only able to place them in code. The biggest takeaway I have from this is that you should plot out the control schemes and don't tangle the two in code.</p>

<p>The name “Onomo” came about in the last few hours. Its origin or inspiration is utterly inexplicable. I spent the last 30 or so minutes building a Windows package and submitting the entry.</p>

<p>All told, I worked on Onomo for 34.7 hours.</p>


<h2 id="post-jam" class="separator">Post-jam<a class="para-ref" href="#post-jam"></a></h2>

<p>In the following hour or two after the Compo ended, I built and uploaded Linux and Mac packages. I also managed to play and rate a few entries before the 37 hour mark without sleep, which was curtailed by questions such as “how are you still awake?” and realizing that I was still awake.</p>

<p>After 11.5 delicious hours of sleep and some business in the city, I went on my usual spree of critical analysis, punctuated by asking for Linux-supporting entries on the Ludum Dare IRC channel. There were a few entries that simply blew me away (stay tuned).</p>

<p>Anyhow, I feel it's a bit disingenuous to be critical of others where evermore could be piled on my own work, so I will now offer a critical analysis of it. (I'm too honest for my own good.)</p>

<p>On the surface, there are a few issues of aesthetic and motion:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The characters feel like they are sliding in motion. A weak link between character velocity and animation.</li>

	<li>The worlds are too empty. There are large swaths where there is no non-uniform backdrop to give the player a sense of motion. This easily breaks immersion; an unfortunate misstep for something with aesthetic as its driving force.</li>

	<li>The world isn't detailed enough, and the majority of the world doesn't give feedback or feel alive. It's very static and unmoving. Even if the large swaths of emptiness were filled in, it wouldn't have any depth to it. I can only walk along a single plane in both worlds!</li>
</ol>

<p>As for the monoliths, the chimes mostly stand out, but at least two of them blend in too well to the background music. These chimes can be more easily heard during quieter sections of the music, but their corresponding monoliths should perhaps not have been placed so close to the spawn points. Giving the player a reason to stay (alas, this is a jam) in the game world for a longer period of time, to see what it has to offer, should've been more important.</p>

<p>The monolith activation mechanism is unclear and tedious. It practically requires the player to position both characters next to the linked monoliths and move one immediately after the other to ensure the second chime occurs while the first is playing (yes, this is exactly how it works). It would've been better and easier to understand if there was a continuous sound as the player stood in front of the monoliths. That way the player would not have to scramble between worlds and time the chimes.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a jam “game”, and I only worked on it over 48 hours, but these are all valid criticisms. I make these points for all of the entries I rate. My reason for doing so is to help developers improve their skills and hopefully observe things about their work that they may have never considered. Of course a large part of learning in game jams comes from the <em>process</em> of creation, but I think hearing different perspectives is also very important. If more Ludum Darians offered their thoughts, the experience would be all the better.</p>

<p>Onomo has become yet another concept I'd like to expand and explore, just as with my Ludum Dare 26 game, Prisma. I've been building togo not only to learn about data-oriented design and engine structure, but also to have a scaffolding on which I'd feel comfortable placing a proper Prisma (and now a proper Onomo). togo will remain my focus for a long while into the future, and I think Prisma will still be its primary motivator, though I envision other ideas will come along as it matures. No concept is perfect or inherently better than any other, so I'm not worried about this prospect. Every concept can be “better” than another with enough attention and development. When I feel that I can build something <em>complete</em>, I will also have a better picture of my abilities and what ideas are most compelling.</p>

<p>I suspect I will be writing about excellent Ludum Dare entries around the time the ratings are posted. Until then, go forth and critique, fellow Ludum Darians!</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Back in May 2011, I was leading the design of an RPG&hellip; as its only programmer. It was a failure. However! Programming for games is a lot of fun. I love systems, and game systems offer a lot of really neat problems. So I'm going to do it again &mdash; <em>without</em> an RPG involved.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to revisit the engine I wrote for that RPG, and now I have the time to do it. The code is horrific, though, so I'm practically starting over from scratch. It's better that way (no, <em>really</em>). I've also been planning to remake &amp; expand Prisma, so this fits in nicely. I can fuel design patterns by what is needed in Prisma.</p>

<p>Onsang is still going (and hey, it kinda looks like it's actually evolving), but it makes more sense to focus on game system knowledge right now as I'm planning on poking people through July-August in California for employment. I might end up pushing the QA side of things, so who knows what'll happen. Regardless, this is double-fun and good mental exercise.</p>

<p>Even since that scaffold of an RPG, I've been interested in building a rendering system that used command buffers, but not so much about the things that seem to implicitly come along with it (until recently). To achieve maximum speed in such a system, you want to minimize the amount of data you're throwing around, and you <strong>definitely</strong> don't want rampant allocations during a frame. This amounts to using compact data structures and contiguous arrays to minimize cache misses. This approach to systems is often called “data-oriented design” (DOD) or “data-driven design”, where the benefits are not just efficiency, but facilitating task distribution and modularity.</p>

<p>I'm going to take that to heart with the new engine. I've been reading articles of DOD proponents since last weekend, and the patterns make a lot of sense. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bitsquid.se/">bitsquid</a>, for example, <a target="_blank" href="http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part-4-id-lookup.html">decouples</a> systems to encapsulate them and to allow them to manage their storage as optimally as possible. Their “low-level” systems expose IDs instead of pointers so the system is free to store &amp; re-organize its storage as it sees fit. By allowing the system to re-organize its memory, it can (e.g.) ensure its objects are sorted and adjacent, without affecting any IDs to those objects.</p>

<p>This means they can iterate through the objects without wasting CPU time or cache misses on empty slots or memory hopping through distant dynamically-allocated objects (the latter of which you are usually stuck with in something like <code>std::map</code>). For some systems, that might not be necessary, but you still get the benefit of not having dangling pointers, and you have a better guarantee that external systems aren't going to unduly modify the object (because they can't access it without asking for it). In most cases, you don't mutate resource data once it's loaded, so you really don't need mutable access, but if you do, it's O(1) away!</p>

<p>There are downsides, though. It takes some careful thinking to ensure the IDs are unique and cannot be used once the object dies (e.g., when an object is removed, and another added, the new one could have an internal index equal to the index of the removed object). It's not very difficult, and you can usually define a sane upper bound on the number of objects the system will ever possibly use (e.g., do you really need 4 billion sounds?), so you can use a bunch of bits of the ID just for the unique part (e.g., an incrementing counter that wraps around), and leave the rest to store the internal index. An upside to having an upper bound means you can reduce a ton of allocations, and you can form a better understanding of the resources required by a system through its use. I think such deep understanding is going to be extremely valuable.</p>

<p>I'm going to harp on a lot about bitsquid throughout this article, so be prepared.</p>

<p>Another aspect that emerges from DOD is simplicity. Because structures are open and don't prohibit or protect use, whatever wants to use them can do so in the most direct manner. In contrast to OOP, DOD necessitates that anything can do anything to everything that's open. In OOP, you're often hiding data and placing an interface on top to mediate access. Why? Because everything is afraid of being malformed or misused. This might make some sense for software that really, <em>really</em> shouldn't crash and should catch misuse as soon as possible through its design, but in games we just want to run fast and get the code over with. Always having to plaster on a layer of interface &amp; dumb-dumb security slows us down by making things rigid, so why do it? We're not interested in the preemptive assurances that get in our way and slow the game down.</p>

<p>Not having a protective interface over <em>everything</em> doesn't prevent us from crashing hard. We <em>should</em> crash hard when we encounter an error, and we should be vigilant to test for errors, because otherwise they're going to go unnoticed or ignored. It's better to fix the system early before everything depends on its broken behavior. This is, naturally, also <a target="_blank" href="http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2012/01/sensible-error-handling-part-1.html">something bitsquid does</a>. Instead of removing that “pesky” triggering assertion that's due to malformed input, just fix the malformed input. Is the error too strict? Evaluate it and decide whether it should be removed or turned into a warning instead. For example, we may want to error when we encounter an animation that has a bajillion bones, but it <em>could</em> be totally legitimate, so a warning would be more sane until we have a real reason to prohibit it &mdash; e.g., an upper bound on the animation system's support for bones.</p>

<p>Back to decoupling. How do you share data if everything is disparate and in its own little universe? More data! Low-level systems can have an output stream of events or a way to poll per-frame (whatever makes more sense for the system). To connect low-level systems, you can use a higher-level system that knows about all of the systems involved. For example, the <code>Game</code> might want to connect HIDs to the <code>Player</code>, so it could poll the input system and send off to the player, the binding manager, whatever. By patching things together, we can design the interfaces to only deal with what they know, which reduces their complexity.</p>

<p>You might say that puts a lot of strain on the high-level system to connect things. True, but it's <em>much</em> better than distributing the interface to so many systems that you end up with an unmaintainable spaghetti of references, global objects, and code fluff. It moves the complexity away from the low-level systems and into the high-level systems where we can be more intelligent about the way they are connected. By connecting in a higher-level system, we reduce the complexity of the lower-level systems and increase their modularity. You can take any system out of the equation and replace it with another as long as it's not intrinsically attached to any other system.</p>

<p>What does this mean? We can replace systems at compile time (or even at runtime) to handle specific hardware for optimality, without resorting to expensive virtual calls on interfaces (which is too often only used to facilitate system swapping or so-called extensibility &mdash; booo). The internals could be implemented to avoid such nonsense (i.e., since we expose an event stream or polling, that's most of the interface, and it can differ internally), but still give it the modularity to support different hardware/capabilities efficiently. Most of the time, what you end up removing <em>due</em> to the removal of a system should only be in the high-level system. That will be a good indication that your systems are decoupled.</p>

<p>DOD obviously has a lot of implications for the code. Data is nearly always public, interfaces stay out of structures for POD traits (and really for uniformity when you want to extend the interface for dealing with a type), and abstract classes mostly disappear, but they are still valuable. For example, data streaming is already a costly operation, and we want to be able to use it on-demand from <em>different kinds</em> of storage media. We could hide this behind a little system that takes requests and gives back blobs, but it'd end up being global, since a lot of stuff is going to need data. We could keep it encapsulated and pass along streams from the high-level systems, but it's very roundabout, and adds more interface to our systems. In reality, you're going to have some resource system to fill up those systems, so the low-level storage media access should be disparate even from that. It doesn't fit into our system model. It's much easier to give it an abstract interface and allow different implementations of it for memory/file/whatever access and use it appropriately within the resource system.</p>

<p>Of course, you may only ever need standard filesystem access, so maybe you don't need the abstract interface. That's fine, but its consequences should be considered early on. What if you move to a server-client model (for tooling, the actual game, etc.)? You're probably going to want to stream over the network, or at least into memory <em>for</em> the network system, so your streams are going to then need direct memory support or support for a network buffer. What about platform support? You could handle that by using PIMPL, including different code, or by using a bunch of macros to determine the platform &amp; change the code accordingly, but then you end up with some manner of code spaghetti and have to either switch the type data or duplicate the whole interface for each platform.</p>

<p>If you foresee anything of that nature with something used in many places or heavily dependent on the platform (in this case, storage media access), you probably want a virtual interface. It separates the different implementations and makes the code simpler. You still have to duplicate the interface, but with an abstract class you have a <em>constraint</em> on what the interface is supposed to provide. This helps in maintainability when you change an interface. You don't have to guess whether a change has made it to all of the platform-specific implementations because <em>the compiler tells you</em>.</p>

<p>The core of my engine is going to be modeled around bitsquid's <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/bitsquid/foundation">foundation library</a>. Having the interface separate from most types isn't very critical for something I'm authoring, since any extension to the interface I would make would be core and could thus be in-class if the interfaces were designed that way, but I'm going to do it anyways. Style shifts are fun!</p>

<p>It has other benefits, such as moving the recompilation factor to the <em>interface</em> and the code that includes it &mdash; away from the <em>type</em>, which rarely changes. These types have public data to facilitate the built-in functionality (since the interface consists of non-friend free functions), which happens to enable anyone else to add functionality. In addition to reducing recompilation from monolithic headers, code only includes what it uses and doesn't incur extra cost from the stuff that it doesn't need. This means types that <em>only</em> need a type definition (i.e., <em>none</em> of its interface) don't incur the cost of the interface.</p>

<p>Granted, you can design code to work like this without separating the interface from the class, but you still end up with inclusion spaghetti due to dependencies. <em>That's</em> what causes infectious recompilation, especially with class templates, which still costs more time due to the interface being needlessly included. You could move the interface <em>definitions</em> out of the class and still have the problem simply because the <em>declarations</em> are still a part of the class, and you then additionally have the maintenance cost of syncing the declaration and implementation files.</p>

<p>Like the foundation libray, my types are grouped together by &hellip; type. Core types, collection types, math types, etc. Interface headers (obviously) include the required type headers, so you only ever need to include the interface header for a type if you need to use functionality for it. If you need types, you have fewer headers to include since they're grouped. Because types rarely change, the recompilation factor of doing this is minimal. Interfaces change far more often, and it's less work to maintain &amp; include few headers (which, again, are small because there's no interface in the type headers).</p>

<p>A downside I've already noticed is the boilerplate caused with free functions for class templates. The template specification has to be repeated for each function. If I were doing this in my own style, that would be unnecessary because everything for a class template would be declared <em>and</em> defined in-class (which is undesired here for aforementioned reasons). It's not that bad, though. At least I don't have to repeat the <em>entire</em> declaration like you have to do with non-header implementations (or with separate declarations and definitions). It does have a nice side-effect for the objects the functions operate on: data member prefixes/suffixes are not needed because you always have to go through the object to get at its members, and thus there are no name confusions.</p>

<p>I'm again taking bitsquid's cue here by using a single prefix underscore for internal data members, just to indicate that something should only be mutated if you know what you're doing. My motto here is “the user should protect the user from the user”, but I'm still going to furiously flip tables via assertions if they misuse the existing interface. I'm still going to have (free function) accessors for these internal data members, because the data in a type <em>might</em> change (and thus have a significant effect on anything that directly accesses its members), because it's more consistent with accessor-like functions that make small calculations, and finally because writing <code>array._size</code> is kinda bleh. This is in contrast to my usual internal data members with <code>m_</code> as a prefix. Arguments of readability against something like that don't work on me (because I can read it just fine and “m_this m_is_hard m_to m_read” is never a real occurrence in code), but here I'm making an exception just to see how it goes. The rest of the design isn't really in my style either, so why not.</p>
 
<p>One thing I'm definitely <em>not</em> doing is repeating declarations just so the documentation is in a smaller area. Documentation is best represented outside of code, and editors these days can jump to functions if you really need to look at the code instead of the documentation (and why do you need to see just the documentation <em>in-code</em> if you already have documentation elsewhere?).</p>

<p>I'm very tempted to use the facilities from duct++ for the engine, but I really want to avoid using the stdlib if I can help it (which duct++ uses somewhat significantly). This is pedantic for someone that isn't doing “AAA” games where performance is critical because of all the stupid pixels, but I see it as a way to learn how all of this works. Making a game is the motivation to write the engine, but it has its own values and intrigue that will keep me plenty happy even if I don't get to actually making the game. I'm a system designer, which games have, but first and foremost <em>need</em> before they can be games, so I have plenty of fun in the backend.</p>

<p>I might end up using a few specific things from duct++, like compiler detection and endian handling, which don't include any (or little) of the stdlib.</p>

<p>Pedantic motivations justified, there are still good reasons to avoid the C++ stdlib. I can have a more intimate understanding of the algorithms and structures I'm using and can tailor them specifically to the needs of the engine. Everything in the engine can be consistent in style and (hopefully) behavior. I'm not forced to deal with the mental and (supposedly minor, now) performance cost of exceptions (which are unnecessary since I want to crash hard) and I have less platform-/implementation-specific junk to deal with (case in point: <a target="_blank" href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/890664/vs-14-ctp-cos-returns-bogus-results-in-64-bit-build">Microsoft broke <code>cos()</code></a>, granted <code>cos()</code> is not something I'm going to write).</p>

<p>I have yet to seriously dig into the rendering system design, but it's also going to be bitsquid-inspired. Ideally, rendering will be distributed into tasks, merged for sorting, then distributed again to the hardware. Sort keys are really neat, surprisingly simple, and I can't wait to play with them.</p>

<p>I need to stop expounding on this article and get back to the code. Hopefully I'll have something interesting to write about on this topic in the near future. Here's a list of what I've been reading:</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>If the existence of this pettily-titled post doesn't already tell you, <span title="there. he gave you the TL;DR. now shoo">I don't know “who” I am.</span> I don't even know what that question <em>means</em>. It doesn't mean “by what means do I summarize who you are?”. Or at least <em>I</em> don't mean that. Most people just want to summarize &amp; reduce. I want to know “who” I am to the fullest extent. I haven't been very successful on my own.</p>

<p>Whenever I think about myself &ndash; whenever I try to dig deeper &ndash; it's only about the anguish of the past, the indecision &amp; ennui &amp; loneliness of the eternal present, the dread &amp; uncertainty of the future. It only reminds me of what I already know; it has nothing to do with finding out “who” I am. What I don't know is how I appear to others. Is that what I mean? Most of what I understand &ndash; if not <em>about</em> me, then about unburdening myself &ndash; comes from talking with <em>real live humans</em>, something I rarely get a chance to do in a meaningful degree.</p>

<p>I rarely talk to <em>new people</em> (who seem nice) unreservedly. If they're distant from family, this is more likely to happen, since there's a smaller chance of <em>stuff</em> seeping out and burdening them &amp; me further. It's simply easier if it stays out of their reach. Other times I talk anyways, because the <span title="damn you, word. he didn't ask for this">hurt</span> can potentially rescind for a while. It's nice to feel like you're making a connection with another person, but I'm simultaneously filled with fear of scaring them away or burdening them. <em>Maybe if I don't say these things, they'll stay. But if I say meaningless nothings, they certainly won't want to interact with me&hellip; But if I keep desperately talking about this, they're going to think I'm attached and still not want to interact with me!</em></p>

<p>I'm a tilted introvert &mdash; a person desperate for interaction, trapped in a vessel of anxiety over how I deal with others, feeling very out of place in social functions, even when I “know” the people there. I <em>want</em> to make a base connection with other people, to understand them, for them to understand me, but it doesn't come easily. I've never been a sympathetic person, just a selfishly aimless person hoping to figure out myself one day. I cast people I don't know as though they are already part of the dreadful monologue going on in my head. I forget boundaries and “bring them up to speed” (to make an analogy). <em>Maybe they don't want to hear your life story, idiot.</em></p>

<p>That's when I start being cautious &amp; fearful. <em>Does this matter to them? Would they think this is petty? They don't owe me anything. They don't deserve this. What's that? Fantastic, now I don't understand the context of what they're talking about.</em> It doesn't help that I'm easily distracted by background noise, and often don't fully grasp what someone says (typically because I didn't hear them entirely or process what I was hearing). My responses are weak and ingenuine. How can I expect them to want to listen to me if I can hardly listen to them? Even when I can hear and understand them, I tell myself I can hardly expect them to wait while I construct a coherent response in my head, not that I'm able to anyways, with the anxiety.</p>

<p>My functional responses most often occur online, where I have the freedom of my mind to actually think, undisturbed by social anxiety. It feels like the results are still inconsiderate and crude, which I imagine is due to my demented introspection. It's harder to fit yourself into other people's shoes, and my shoes are unforgivingly tattered. The latter comes out, the effects of which I'm already immune to, by nature of having been exposed to it (and worse) for my conscious life. Others, not as much? That's what I tell myself, and I feel that I'm being too raw and inconsiderate whenever I think about what I've said.</p>

<p>My social anxiety turns into a barer communication anxiety when I mull over what I've said. I have to try really hard to cast the majority of that mess away as unfixable. I can't go back in time. For online communication, even where I have time to think, I still end up wishing I said something different. <em>Oops, I put them in <strong>my shoes</strong> again. That makes no sense. That was inconsiderate. I forgot to respond to something. I misinterpreted them. I put too much emphasis on something. They haven't responded; should I not have said that?</em> I get dread &amp; anxiety even waiting for responses to the most “normal” conversations, even when discussing things that have nothing to do with me as a person.</p>

<p>I believe it's my problem, but whenever I've told people how they can go about fixing a poorly-designed system, I've felt ignored or dismissed. Am I really that useless? Maybe it's just the people I've interacted with in those situations. Most of it was in a volunteer environment where no one was required to heed my ideas.</p>

<p>There are still boundaries I gladly set for most people, but strangely don't set for detached communities. In some parts of the Internet, people won't hurt you just for “who” you are or what has happened to you. You can say things (even things that are dangerous &amp; dreadful to even hint at in person) into those voids, but you won't make connections. If you repeat yourself, people get bothered (as they should in person), and you end up further desensitizing &amp; distancing yourself from what you're talking about.</p>

<p>If people knew everything, they'd easily think I'm depressed &mdash; or worse. If you look on the surface level, you might make a guess due to my low rate of interaction, or just assume I'm shy (I'm not; just awkward and <span title="GO AWAY, WORD">sad</span>). It's down there, somewhere, but I don't passively feel it. I keep my emotions fairly well contained around others (considering <em>life</em> &hellip; actually, as its outcome), but as a result I lose the capacity to sympathize and respond in emotionally appropriate manners (it's either nil or an explosion). <em>I'm not smiling because I'm happy. I'm smiling because I don't want you to think something is wrong. I can't even turn it off. Stop looking at me.</em> It probably makes me dull, and it's easy to feel that my “problems” are petty compared to others' (and oh are they ever).</p>

<p>Whenever I find someone who I feel I could make a connection with, all of that unravels. Then we don't see each-other for a long time, usually because <em>life</em> just makes it that way. If I see them again, the fear still sets in, and I'm afraid of burdening them by continuing my dreadful exposition. <em>Why should they have to listen to this? Do they even remember what I said?</em> Nothing resolves, and I don't figure out who I am to them. It doesn't help to ask, since you are asking something that people can't be genuine about unless they know you very well. No one knows me well. I don't know me well. An insipid hyperbole from someone who thinks they know me is worse than an ingenuine sense given by someone who doesn't quite know me, but is still closer than those who think they do. I will never, ever, trust the former.</p>

<p>With the latter kind of people, I imagine I come off as immensely sad, since the stuff I pull up drags volatile, old emotions along with it. I'm not passively sad, I just keep all of it bottled up. It'd be nice to figure out “who” I am without having to bring up any of that, but it'd make me think the “who” is still ingenuine. There's a lot of stuff down there that makes up my personage.</p>

<p>“Get a therapist” I hear you say. Perhaps even from the onset. Do you know why I don't have one? If I did, I would have to admit that I've been thoroughly screwed up for a long time. Remember how I said it's easier if it stays out of the reach of people who already know me. Admitting it, even hinting at it (with something as dreadful as a “seeing a therapist”, no less), would be unbearably disheartening. Even if it didn't unravel for them, some of them would have all the more skittish interactions with me, afraid they'll trigger something, which in itself <span title="hehe">meta-triggers</span>. <em>I'm still human, you know. Do you think you've helped? You've only made it worse throughout my life.</em> Bringing up old baggage with people I know would be a disaster. An utter disaster.</p>

<p>Not to mention I'd be diseased by the thought that this person is just trying to get into my head to bypass all of the muck and reset the mains. There's something innately disturbing about psychotherapy, to me. Everything would still be petty, but they wouldn't be allowed to be genuine. They have a job to do, a living to make, just like everyone else. I'm not looking for cheap catharsis or deadpan “understanding”, I want to know what all of this makes me to others.</p>

<p>Am I a trustworthy person? (I hope so.) Are my opinions useful? (Don't seem to be.) Am I helpful? (Only as a slave.) Do I have a purpose? (What?) Am I lovable? Am I actually capable of loving? (In theory.) Can I “connect” with others and make reasonable relationships where I'm not a thorn to the other person? (I dream of it.) Will I ever resolve my burdens and stop bothering people about them? I don't trust any of that to actually be resolved outside of interaction with people who can be genuine about them. <em>I'll take a cup of natural, please. A side of someone I already know telling me sweet hyperbolic nothings? No thanks.</em></p>

<p>If someone were to just directly answer those questions, I wouldn't accept it. Being told “you are X/Y” isn't an answer; seeing how others interact with you and talk to others about you &ndash; <strong>genuinely</strong> &ndash; is. The people who can talk “about” me to others don't really know me, thus perpetuating a fake personage I now have the burden of upholding or meticulously deconstructing. <em>No, going to San Francisco was never a thing until very recently, and please stop telling people that.</em> But can everyone know “who” I am? Is that safe? At least don't give them the false personage. He's an impossible standard. I hate him.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The future isn't always dreadfully uncertain. At times it can be dreadfully uncertain in an <em>exciting</em> manner. <em>If I leave, maybe then I can find humans who can help with this dumb quest.</em> Unfortunately, I don't trust the future. It's an inimical, deceitful chimera. It's not an exciting dread when you know it's going to disintegrate, or when you can see that it's only going to be more of the same eternal present.</p>

<p>How do you even find productivity or creativity in the sight of that? The little bit of fiction writing that I've done over the past few years (which, as I should note, has decreased) has had no actual drive or purpose. I don't write knowing what I'm going to write. It just comes out from circumstance and dull logical or random processes to fill the void around the previous weird idea (ad infinitum). Sometimes I get little spouts of random joy and write ridiculous fluff like “All out” and “Quiddlopolis”, which only serve to flip my weird little switches with their absurdity. Part 2 of the latter has been a draft since last August. I haven't felt that way for a while, to say the least, and now I have the task of upholding the previous narrative.</p>

<p>It certainly didn't help that I was (until now) doing a job which was endlessly mind-dulling, in an <em>environment</em> at odds with my modus operandi and curious-creative core. The actual work itself might've been bearable if it wasn't for every idiot that ever touched code. Between the earlier random (and otherwise subconscious) distraction of working remote and later 10-12 hour workdays, I certainly didn't have the energy or time to coax the will or desire to do much of anything wholesome. I wasn't even able to realize until recently that I was exceedingly sad-happy when I (nearly-) unreservedly talked to someone I just met. Someone that I'm now fearful of further exposing myself to because of their closeness to people that know me, but also someone I feel uncensored and comfortable with.</p>

<p>Speaking of censorship, I've been censoring “who” I am since before I even had conscious thoughts about it. My interests, my beliefs, my ideals &mdash; all of that is censored to them because I'm afraid that they won't like them, will no longer talk to me, or increase my burdens without even considering it. <em>Maintain the status quo, because a negative deviation will make it worse.</em> It's easier to uncensor myself away from people I know, or with people who I can't lose because I don't even have them. The self-censorship is only going to go away when I have actual <em>freedom</em> of myself, and I certainly don't have it here.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I'm comfortable in silence. The “background” sound of day and fluctuating probabilities of others' lives incessantly invade my mind. I've found that most of my creativity and productivity comes when the only consistent things I can hear are my keyboard and the various fans in my room &mdash; in other words, white noise, glorious ambiance uncorrupted by humans and their infectious negative emotions.</p>

<p>At night, I am scarcely bothered by others. My mind is freed from most worries (<em>oh, cool, they did that less stupidly than I expected; oh, cool, they didn't die</em>), even though, were these worries to be validated, I'd be mostly as indifferent as ever. Indifference is a cheap defense mechanism, but it works most of the time. Its weak cap can be blown by “normal” levels of others' negative emotions, which I don't witness nearly as much as I used to.</p>

<p>I think I'm comfortable in loneliness, too, but not because I like being alone. I like being <em>away</em> from <em>that</em>. I trust you see the distinction. When I was a young'un('er), I used to escape to the forest or ride my bike to nowhere to get away. I remember being very cozy out in a snowstorm where you could hardly see some 10 meters ahead. I was called back (from quite a distance), as usual, cutting my awayness short. I've always found innate comfort in the midst of a snowswept environment, and even though I hate the cold, it brings a peculiar kind of warmth.</p>

<p>Nowadays I only derive similar feelings from the innate, homely joy from trains' horns &amp; cozy rumble (which remind me of my apparent childhood obsession with trains and similar earlier feelings described not by any kind of interest) and the occasional gaze up at the night sky. The former reminds me of less burdensome times, and the latter reminds me how immeasurably awesome the universe is and how immeasurably pathetic mine is. Sometimes I hear the rumble of a train when there isn't any. I think they'll always remind me of peace.</p>

<p>I thought everyone could change, but most of them can't or just don't. It might seem like they change at times, but they're still the same person underneath. No one can rid themselves of all the baggage that comes with growing up on Earth. In or <em>beneath</em> society. That ghastly personage still comes out, or never leaves the base level of the person's external behavior. Most “change” is extra fluff layered on top; a façade.</p>

<p>I used to have an unrelenting zeal to make <em>stuff</em> (or so I tell myself). Now I'd be lucky to feel that. Now I just hope to make a multi-year, stupidly complex software project functional and complete selfish writings like this, deluding myself that anything I do improves my worth. I used to be able ignore everything by hanging out with <span title="S I N G U L A R">a friend</span>, to which it wouldn't've mattered if they knew everything, even though we rarely interacted at that level. Now I just sit in regret that I was never able to “connect”. I don't think I ever really considered that I could tell those kinds of people things. I was just happy to be with them, even though what we were doing was sub-social and non-normative (in stark contrast to what they'd do when interacting with any of their other friends).</p>

<p>I often feel detached from my physical form and my given identity. <em>Oh, this is my body. So I look like that.</em> It's probably mostly my fault for donning indifference and sealing things up. I don't identify with my birth name, and now the processing of someone calling my name is somewhat slower than it should be, if it even registers. <em>“Should I call you Timothy or?”  “Oh, uh, Tim is fine.”</em> I have to prepare that identity so that I don't fall short of the false personage.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I have gender dysphoria &ndash; that my behaviors and feelings are more “feminine” than not &ndash; but honestly it's just a desperate solace to justify why I'm broken, even if some of it <em>is</em> true. I'm so heterogametic that the mere suggestion is insulting to my body.</p>

<p>I tell myself I'd still be gynephilic if I were female, but that's not how life works. If I were biologically XX, I wouldn't <em>be</em> me. It completely resets the timeline, and it'd be practically impossible to reach even a vague resemblance of the one I have now. It's a hopeless, pointless venture, much like wishing you didn't do <em>X</em> or could redo <em>Y</em> in your childhood. <em>I could just solve everything if I could go back in time and do it differently.</em> But then you're not you. And you can't anyways, so what difference does it make? Why are you even thinking about this? My gender shouldn't matter.</p>

<p>I like to think I accept that, but I don't. It seeps back through and really frustrates me. <em>Why am I like this? Why does it bother me so much?</em></p>

<p>Why am I writing this? I think it's due to having no peers who I feel completely comfortable with. Most of them I'm either afraid of losing or I think they wouldn't be able to offer anything. It feels weird to even consider them as people that could help, and I know they have plenty of their own pain already. I write chaff like this to hope I figure something out, but I usually don't. It's the same as introspection, except it's a public vulnerability, and potentially one that will find its way to the wrong hands. Somehow that doesn't deter me. If I intend to post what I write, I write at a meta level instead of writing about what actually ails me, so it is different from introspection. All of that is going on in the back of my mind, but I'm outputting something completely different.</p>

<p>I don't answer any questions, I just get better at talking about them.</p>

<p>What a disaster that was.</p>

<p>Let's see here.. overview first. I spent 31 days house-sitting and subsequently 71 living with my grandmother (from the end of March), the latter while suffering from a severe chronic headache and paired mental impairment. This obliterated focus, efficiency, and progress on <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>After July, the headache got somewhat better (presumably due to diet and return to the homestead), but it took until late November to develop a functional theory: fructose malabsorption. Tweaking saccharide consumption resolved the issue (yet another slow downramp), although there were undoubtedly other factors (especially from my grandmother's house).</p>

<p>(And yes, I did visit a doctor in June. They had no theories. Nutrition tracking in Onsang is going to be glorious&hellip; <em>*drools*</em>.)</p>

<p>During the first month I was with my grandmother, I somehow managed to make <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=14542">Prisma</a> for Ludum Dare 26. It's amazing this thing is even coherent.</p>

<p>For study, I planned on taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII"><em>Algorithms, Part II</em></a> (which started in April), but I didn't have the health nor time for it. I later took and "completed"<sup><a href="#fn-a4p2-completion">1</a></sup> the second run in November. I also took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI"><em>Algorithms, Part I</em></a> again for good measure and crammed in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/calc1"><em>Calculus One</em></a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/maththink"><em>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</em></a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun"><em>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/automata"><em>Automata</em></a>. The last one seemed to be low-quality, so I didn't do any of the material. I also dropped the Scala course very early because I deemed it not worthwhile.</p>

<p>Yet the remaining workload was too taxing for the weekend, so I ended up dropping the rest of them (five or so weeks in), excepting the <em>Algorithms</em> courses. For <em>Part I</em>, I revisited material and revised code for assignments, so there wasn't much workload there (and I only intended to skim over it anyhow, since I had already completed the run back in March).</p>

<p>Once I was back home, work kept me busy &amp; interrupted. The headache and mental impairment made effort on projects inefficient and slow (even when at its lowest potency). Hopefully now that it's gone I can finally get some Serious Time rolling.</p>

<h2 id="goal-review" class="separator">Goal review<a class="para-ref" href="#goal-review"></a></h2>

<p>Earlier in the year I <a href="/self/aiming-for-the-ground-often-missing/">sketched out</a> my goals for 2013. Most have not happened, and the rest that "have" are not complete.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Static site generator</strong>. I haven't even touched the design since January. Jekyll has gotten somewhat better (speed-wise) and I <em>know</em> the way my sites are setup is disgusting (yes, that's Jekyll's fault), but I've forgotten precisely why, so I don't feel the urgent desire to replace it. I'd still like to roll my own at some point.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Log keeper rebuild</strong>. This is very much WIP, but I've got an initial API (<a href="https://github.com/komiga/hord">Hord</a>) working and theoretically-correct networking complete for the server/client (<a href="https://github.com/komiga/Onsang">Onsang</a>).</p>

	<p>So far I've created three libraries to assist the project: <a href="https://github.com/komiga/trait_wrangler">Trait Wrangler</a> (trait testing), <a href="https://github.com/komiga/ceformat">ceformat</a> (constexpr printf-like format parser and stdlib I/O library writer), and <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Beard">Beard</a> (terminal-based UI). I hope to have something up and running once Beard is usable &mdash; and I can't wait. I have wondrous, ridiculous, and 100% obsessive ideas for Onsang's use.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Android time tracker</strong>. I'm putting this one off until Onsang matures. I intend to move all of my time tracking into Hord nodes so that the various logs aren't disparate (as is currently the case).</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>ØMQ broker</strong>. I hoped to have a use for this in Onsang, but now I don't think I'll be using ØMQ, so it's on the back-burner until I find it interesting again.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Game engine</strong>. It needs a redesign.. which I haven't dug into. It'll probably happen once I'm done with my current contract work, since I'm still aiming to make Prisma into a Real Game™ (although that's reciprocal because I'm going to use Prisma as a guinea pig to flesh out the engine).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2014-starter-interests" class="separator">2014 starter interests<a class="para-ref" href="#2014-starter-interests"></a></h2>

<p>There are too many awesome things in our universe. Here are some of my interests coming into 2014.</p>

<p>I learned of <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net">SuperCollider</a> just last week from Jeremy Zuckerman, and it's probably one of the coolest language-environments I've ever seen. This reignited my interest in audio, and I'm going to devote some time to learning SuperCollider for generative/responsive music creation and sound foley. I'm also tacking on some music theory.</p>

<p>On the visual side of things, I've been mulling over how to maximize visualization via imagination in a non-interactive medium. Books (and writing in general) are great because of the imagery and atmosphere you can conjure from them. I still vividly remember scenes from books like <em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em>, <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, and <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em> &mdash; far more vividly than I can remember any of the countless comic pages I've read.</p>

<p>It's not just a static representation, either. I can step through parts of the scene and see its angles and people and creatures. I find several reasons for this.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Books have longer spans of engagement, and the only tool at the reader's disposal is their imagination. Length of engagement certainly affects the retention of the imagined scenes and the play within it.</p></li>

	<li><p>On the flip size, the engagement in a comic is very low unless the reader is going through entire chapters in a single sitting. For web comics, the reader will spend a very small amount of time reading new pages (once they've gone through the backlog). Comics take all of the written imagery and turn it into literal imagery, but in doing so remove the reader's imagination from the equation. This is inherent, and the shorter length of engagement reduces even the retention of the speech.</p></li>

	<li><p>BRAINS.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I enjoy reading and writing stories where the reader's imagination is only nudged part-way with descriptions and left to conjure the form and dynamics. To me, giving the reader a unique experience of the story is a lot more exciting than setting the imagery in stone with art. The annoyance is that I find it difficult to convey imagery in a succinct and natural manner with written English. I'd like something more expressive, but I can't think of a decent way to expand into existing media without losing the imaginative element.</p>

<p>Simply using cued audio <em>could</em> work, but I'd have to be really careful with timing and flow. As soon as the reader wants to read the previous page, the mood is generally upended. And the text gets chopped down into bits that can actuate an audio effect, meaning there's a lot of page turning and smaller chunks of text&hellip; meaning the reader is upending flow a lot more often. It gets ugly.</p>

<p>Actually, audio is really only complementary. The text still has to describe things. The audio will only ever be a layer plastered on to help with the nudging.</p>

<p>It's possible I'm just a poor writer (I am) and haven't yet found the secret formula. I imagine this desire will remain for years unless I either 1. figure out how to expand; or 2. improve my modus operandi to the point where it doesn't bother me. I should probably keep writing.</p>

<h2 id="data" class="separator">Data<a class="para-ref" href="#data"></a></h2>

<p>I tracked 8747.7 hours total in 2013 with 14350 entries. 12.3 hours are mysteriously missing.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Study, projects, and work</strong> (~2121.6 hours):</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>876.6 hours: project programming (616 public commits), 966.0 total tagged as coding. Compare to (more efficient): 823.1 in 2012 and 1149.5 in 2011 (for which only 10 months were tracked!).</p></li>
	<li><p>591.6 hours: working, 59.5 of which were spent writing packaging documentation. Compare to: 239.4 in 2012 and 140.9 in 2011.</p></li>
	<li><p>304.9 hours: coursework (mostly programming) and study.</p></li>
	<li><p>178.8 hours: designing games.</p></li>
	<li><p>~121.3 hours: writing (non-work; probably overlaps a bit with game design).</p></li>
	<li><p>31.8 hours: playtesting.</p></li>
	<li><p>16.6 hours: video game quality assurance (related to above, but specifically: writing bug reports, investigating, and gathering data).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Entertainment</strong> (579.7 hours):</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>268.2 hours: watching anime (224.3, eep) and western television (basically The Legend of Korra × 2 and Avatar: The Last Airbender) (43.9). Compare to: 255.8/40.0 in 2012.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>941.4 hours: tagged IRC (span-wise; does not accurately represent time spent solely communicating in IRC).</p></li>
	<li><p>658.9 hours: netloop; 425.2 tagged reddit (&hellip; terrible!), 208.9 tagged twitter, 91.7 tagged feedread (RSS, blogs, comics and such).</p></li>

<img src="/media/2013-09-30-poq/titlepiece.png" class="generic-center" style="display: block;" alt="Prince of Qin logo" title="Prince of Qin logo" />

<p>Despite its numerous flaws, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Qin_(video_game)"><em>Prince of Qin</em></a> is one of few video games I hold in high regard. It's also a game that I am irrationally attached to. It won't leave me in peace. Or vice versa.</p>

<p>This article is sort-of documentation for the game and a chronicle of my time with it. I give a history and overview of <em>Prince of Qin</em> &amp; its related games, my experience with the game, and its possible futures in my care.</p>

<p>I supply Simplified Chinese for introductions, as well as pinyin and IPA where appropriate; if the pinyin is absent, its transliteration is roughly equivalent to the Chinese. If you want to learn more about the Qin Dynasty, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian"><em>Shiji</em></a> (史記) covers it extensively. I cite specific passages from Burton Watson's translation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Records-Grand-Historian-Dynasty-ebook/dp/B005DB3HSS"><em>Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty</em></a> (2013, 3rd edition) as SHIJI in the footnotes, although a fair majority of the storyline section is derived from it.</p>

<p>Fair warning: the next section is probably very boring. Skip past it if you're not interested in the time period in which <em>Prince of Qin</em> was released.</p>

<p>Alright, let's get at this tiger-fish!<sup><a href="#fn-did-you-hear-it">1</a></sup></p>


<h2 id="history" class="separator">History<a class="para-ref" href="#history"></a></h2>

<p>Object Software began development on <a target="_blank" href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/秦殇">《秦殇》</a> (<em>Qin War</em>; pinyin: Qín Shāng; IPA: /tɕʰin ʂɑŋ/) in 2000 and released in China during July 2002. They partnered with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_First">Strategy First</a> to release in the United States market under the title <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Qin_(video_game)"><em>Prince of Qin</em></a> and brought a beta of the English version to E3 2002.</p>

<p>It was released to the US market in August 2002 with a full English dub. Reviewers criticized clunky mechanics, poor voice acting, and poor translation, but often praised the aesthetic, history-derivation, and music.<sup><a href="#fn-music">2</a></sup> These latter factors generally saved it from utterly dismal reviews. Western media often compared it to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II"><em>Diablo II</em></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate"><em>Baldur's Gate</em></a>.</p>

<p>Object Software also partnered with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capcom">Capcom</a> to release in the Japanese market under the title 「天覇光芒記　～プリンス・オブ・シン～」 (<em>difficult-to-translate Japanese-ey head-title &ndash; Prince of Qin</em>; romaji: Tenpakoubouki &ndash; Purinsu obu Shin). The release was pushed to August 2003 due to the localization team's pre-occupation with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos"><em>Warcraft III</em></a> and, unlike Strategy First, Capcom did not dub their release.</p>

<p>Online multiplayer began in China and the US shortly after release with a capacity of 500 players. The online service was called “Battle.Net” despite not having any relation whatsoever to Blizzard's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle.net">online gaming service</a>.</p>

<p>Also after the Chinese and US releases, Object Software shifted to developing online-only games and made public an online-only standalone “expansion” called <em>Prince of Qin Online - The Overlord of Conquerors</em> (later called <em>World of Qin</em>) near the end of 2002. This shift was likely due to Blizzard's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> announcement at E3 and the surrounding hype over massively-multiplayer online gaming.</p>

<p>In January 2004, Strategy First partnered with GMX Media to release in the United Kingdom market. Official English multiplayer servers died down through the year as patches reduced server stability and broke some fundamental mechanics.</p>

<p>In the same month, Object Software released its final (to date) singleplayer game: 《复活》 (<em>Resurrection</em>; pinyin: Fùhuó; IPA: /fuxu̯ɔ/), a more mythologically-derived “prequel” to <em>Prince of Qin</em>. GMX Media published the game in the UK in December with a full English dub under the title <em>Seal of Evil</em>. Strategy First later published the game in the US market in April 2006.</p>

<p><em>Seal of Evil</em> illustrates some experiments they would later incorporate into <em>World of Qin 2</em>, which utilized realtime 3D for actors. Object Software later grew into first-person 3D MMOs and hasn't looked back since.<sup><a href="#fn-dou-shen">3</a></sup></p>


<h2 id="storyline" class="separator">Storyline<a class="para-ref" href="#storyline"></a></h2>

<p><em>Prince of Qin</em> features a history-derived story set in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> (221&ndash;206 BCE) surrounding <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusu">Fusu</a> (扶苏), heir apparent of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang">First Emperor</a> (秦始皇帝; pinyin: Qín Shǐ Huángdì), after the First Emperor's death.<sup><a href="#fn-death-of-first-emperor">4</a></sup> What follows is an overview of the period and the events surrounding the story in real-world history.</p>

<p>Near the end of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period">Warring States period</a>, the Qin state <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin%27s_wars_of_unification">conquered and unified</a> the six major states. The king of the Qin state, Zhao Zheng (趙正), became the First Emperor of this unified China.</p>

<p>The Qin Dynasty standardized the units of measurement and currency, formed extensive trade routes, and unified the Chinese script. The First Emperor undertook massive projects, such as the Great Wall of China and his tomb, which is famous for its collection of life-sized <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army">terracotta warriors and horses</a>.</p>

<p>However, the First Emperor used cruel law to control and subdue the people, and most of his tomb's workers were killed to ensure secrecy (by some counts, 300,000&ndash;720,000 people). He ordered <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars#Book_burning">the mass burning of books</a> to suppress scholars (who were accused of raising dissent) and later <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars#Burial_of_the_scholars">buried alive</a> more than 460 scholars<sup><a href="#fn-scholar-count">5</a></sup> after being deceived by two alchemists in his search for immortality, actions that drew criticism from his eldest son, Fusu.</p>

<p>Due to his numerous remonstrances, Fusu was exiled (ca. 212 BCE) to the north to supervise General <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Tian">Meng Tian</a> (蒙恬), who was in charge of the construction of part of the Great Wall (as it was <em>later</em> known). In the subsequent years, Fusu was very successful in protecting the northern border against the Huns and was universally liked among the troops.</p>

<p>In 210 BCE, the First Emperor died on a trip to the far east of the empire in search of an elixir of immortality. As the First Emperor insisted on touring in secrecy, only prime minister <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Si">Li Si</a> (李斯), advisor <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Gao">Zhao Gao</a> (趙高), son <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Er_Shi">Huhai</a> (胡亥) (who was the only member of the royal family traveling with them), and five or six trusted eunuchs knew of his death. Li Si feared news of the emperor's death would trigger an uprising, so he concealed his coffin and returned with the convoy to the capital, Xianyang, all the while concealing the emperor's rapidly decomposing body (due to the summer heat) by ordering carts full of rotten fish be carried behind and ahead of the emperor's wagon.</p>

<p>After two months journey back to the capital, Zhao Gao conspired with Huhai (while only convincing Li Si to play along) to forge an edict claiming various crimes committed by Fusu and Meng Tian and ordering them to commit suicide. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Yi">Meng Yi</a> (蒙毅), Meng Tian's younger brother, sentenced Zhao to death for a crime he committed as a minor official, but the First Emperor pardoned him. Because of this, Zhao held a grudge against the Meng family. He was also afraid Meng Tian's prowess and closeness to Fusu would threaten his position if Fusu ascended the throne.</p>

<p>When the messenger arrived with the edict, Fusu retired to weeping in his inner quarters, intending to commit suicide. Meng Tian stopped him from doing so, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>His Majesty has been residing away from the capital and has not yet designated an heir apparent.<sup><a href="#fn-heir-apparent">6</a></sup> He has put me in command of 300,000 men to guard the border and ordered you to act as supervisor. Such assignments are among the most crucial in the whole empire. Now one messenger appears and immediately you prepare to commit suicide. How do you know that this is not some sort of deception? I urge you to ask for confirmation. If the order is confirmed and you then take your life, no one can say you acted tardily.<sup><a href="#fn-shiji-p190">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Being too loyal<sup><a href="#fn-fusu-reasons">8</a></sup> for his own good, Fusu responded with “If a father instructs his son to commit suicide, how can he ask for confirmation of the order?”<sup><a href="#fn-shiji-p191">9</a></sup> and proceeded to take his life. Meng Tian, however, was unwilling to commit suicide. The messenger turned him over to the officials, who imprisoned him at Yangzhou.</p>

<p>After the messenger returned, Huhai ascended the throne (210 BCE), taking the title of Second Emperor (秦二世; pinyin: Qín Èr Shì), with Zhao Gao as the chief of palace attendants constantly by his side in the inner palace to tend to affairs of state. Zhao spoke ill of the Meng family “day and night” to Huhai. In the same year, Meng Yi was put to death, Meng Tian was forced to commit suicide by poison, and the remaining Meng family was killed.</p>

<p>Zhao exploited Huhai's view of him as a teacher and superior to impose his own agenda, out-running the First Emperor's cruelty, having Li Si executed,<sup><a href="#fn-li-si-execution">10</a></sup> and eventually cornering Huhai himself into suicide through a rather rash move in 207 BCE. After Huhai's death, Zhao tried to install <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziying">Ziying</a> (子嬰), one of Huhai's uncles,<sup><a href="#fn-ziying-heredity">11</a></sup> as the next emperor.</p>

<p>However, Ziying (of royal blood), suspected Zhao was going to have him killed to appease the rebels, so he feigned illness and declined to attend state affairs. He plotted with the eunuch Han Tan (韓談)<sup><a href="#fn-shiji-p205">12</a></sup> to kill Zhao. Zhao eventually came in person to his quarters to inquire about his illness and was killed by Han Tan as he arrived. Ziying then ascended the throne as the King of Qin<sup><a href="#fn-ziying-king">13</a></sup> and executed Zhao Gao's three sets of relatives. He reigned for a short 46 days before surrendering (along with the entire royal family) to a Chu (later Han) rebel leader, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han">Liu Bang</a> (刘邦),<sup><a href="#fn-race-to-guanzhong">14</a></sup> in late 207 BCE.</p>

<p>Liu Bang handed him over to another Chu rebel leader, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Yu">Xiang Yu</a> (项羽), who killed Ziying and the entire royal family. This effectively ended the Qin Dynasty after only 15 years of existence. Liu and Xiang fought over the coming years in the interregnum known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention">Chu&ndash;Han Contention</a>, with Liu eventually defeating Xiang at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaixia">Battle of Gaixa</a> in 202 BCE. Liu then established the admired <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> (206 BCE&ndash;220 CE), becoming Emperor Gao (高皇帝; pinyin: Gāo Huángdì).</p>

<p>At least, that's how it goes in history.</p>

<p><em>Prince of Qin</em> explores what could have happened if Fusu heeded Meng Tian's logic &mdash; or if he was at least as suspicious. The story up to the false edict is the same as real-world history. Fusu is stopped by Meng Tian and flees as Meng Tian and his men hold off the soldiers. A manhunt ensues for Fusu, who has embarked on a journey to Xianyang to discover the truth.</p>

<p>The 11-chapter narrative branches with seven total endings and explores the Qin state. Many of the NPCs encountered in the game are based on their real-world characteristics and known history. Zhao Gao is the main antagonist throughout the game, although there are many obstacles in Fusu's path.</p>

<p><em>Seal of Evil</em>, the so-called “prequel”, takes place in the Warring States period surrounding the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue">Baiyue</a> peoples as the Qin state was rapidly conquering the surrounding area. It largely stands alone and incorporates more Chinese mythology than <em>Prince of Qin</em> does. I have plenty of criticisms about it, but I will not share them presently.</p>


<h2 id="mechanics-and-gameplay" class="separator">Mechanics and gameplay<a class="para-ref" href="#mechanics-and-gameplay"></a></h2>

<p><em>Prince of Qin</em> is a mixture of ARPG and traditional CRPG (with emphasis on the latter, I will argue) with realtime combat (i.e., not turn-based), partially-interactive pausing, and on-demand game saving. In singleplayer mode, the player can recruit and control up to five characters with permadeath (except that when Fusu dies, it's game over).</p>

<p>The first two sub-sections are somewhat detail-heavy to serve as a reference of sorts to fundamentals and build theory, but cover some of the core mechanics and show the classes in action. Most specific values are relative to patch 1.30. I planned on including a gameplay video (as all that I've seen are quite crude), but the forces of evil<sup><a href="#fn-forces-of-evil">15</a></sup> were having none of that AV synchronization business. Fortunately, there're plenty of screenshots.</p>

<h3 id="mechanics-five-elements">The Five Elements<a class="para-ref" href="#mechanics-five-elements"></a></h3>

<p>The Five Elements, based on a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing">real-world concept</a>, are a fundamental mechanic. The elements and their corresponding attack power (<strong>AP</strong>) and defense power (<strong>DP</strong>) abbreviations are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metal (<strong>MAP</strong>, <strong>MDP</strong>)</li>
	<li>Water (<strong>WAP</strong>, <strong>WDP</strong>)</li>
	<li>Wood (<strong>NAP</strong>, <strong>NDP</strong>)</li>
	<li>Fire (<strong>FAP</strong>, <strong>FDP</strong>)</li>
	<li>Earth (<strong>EAP</strong>, <strong>EDP</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I abbreviate elemental AP and DP as <strong>XAP</strong> and <strong>XDP</strong>, respectively (i.e., when referring to elemental AP and DP in an abstract or encompassing sense). There is also so-called “common” attack power (<strong>CAP</strong>) and common defense power (<strong>CDP</strong>), which act outside of the elemental system (i.e., they are neither strong nor weak against XDP and XAP).<sup><a href="#fn-damned-brutes">16</a></sup> Two mechanics control the relationships between these elements.</p>

<img src="/media/2013-09-30-poq/elemental-promotion.png" class="generic-center" style="display: block;" alt="Elemental promotion" title="Illustration of elemental promotion. Starting from the topmost in clockwise order: Metal (gold), Water (blue), Wood (green), Fire (orangered), Earth (brown)." />

<p><strong>Promotion</strong> is a mechanic used to activate “hidden” attributes on items. As seen in the illustration above, the promotion loop is (clockwise, starting from the top): Metal &rarr; Water &rarr; Wood &rarr; Fire &rarr; Earth &rarr; Metal &rarr; <span style="top: -5px; position: relative;">&hellip;</span>. To activate hidden attributes on an equipment item, a specific equipment item type of the promoting element must be worn (e.g., belts promote chest pieces and rings promote weapons &amp; shields).</p>

<img src="/media/2013-09-30-poq/elemental-restriction.png" class="generic-center" style="display: block;" alt="Elemental restriction" title="Illustration of elemental restriction" />

<p><strong>Restriction</strong> is a mechanic controlling the strength and weakness of elements against other elements. As seen in the illustration above, the restriction loop is: Metal &rarr; Wood &rarr; Earth &rarr; Water &rarr; Fire &rarr; Metal &rarr; <span style="top: -5px; position: relative;">&hellip;</span>. Somewhat defying logic, Fire does not restrict Wood. You'll just have to deal with that.</p>

<p>In addition to promotion and restriction, the elements have an offensive chance to inflict short effects:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metal causes stun, which immobilizes the target for a short duration.</li>
	<li>Water causes freezing, which immobilizes the target for a short duration.</li>
	<li>Wood causes poison, which deals damage to the target over time.</li>
	<li>Fire causes blindness, which decreases the target's line of sight, Dodge Rate, and Shoot Rate.</li>
	<li>Earth causes stoning (or “terra-cotta”), which immobilizes the target for a duration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mechanics-basics">Basics and classes<a class="para-ref" href="#mechanics-basics"></a></h3>

<p>Leveling gives the player 10 points to spend on six different attributes and 1 skill point to spend on skills, with skill tiers unlocking periodically up to five tiers. The six directly modifiable attributes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Strength (<strong>Str</strong>):
	<p>Increases CAP and maximum weight capacity. Stock and trade for purely offensive variants.</p></li>

	<li>Constitution (<strong>Con</strong>):
	<p>Increases CDP and HP regeneration. Tank attribute.</p></li>

	<li>Dexterity (<strong>Dex</strong>):
	<p>Increases Dodge Rate (<strong>DR</strong>) and Shoot Rate (<strong>SR</strong>) (accuracy). Generally required for all non-casters.</p></li>

	<li>Savvy (<strong>Sav</strong>):
	<p>Increases rate of experience gain. I am not aware of a sane use for this attribute outside of multiplayer.</p></li>

	<li>Charm (<strong>Cha</strong>):
	<p>Increases value of own items and decreases cost of store items. This has some uses in singleplayer.</p></li>

	<li>Wisdom (<strong>Wis</strong>):
	<p>Increases MP restoration speed and XAP. Stock and trade for casters and element-driven characters.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Health and mana have the typical abbreviations: <strong>HP</strong> and <strong>MP</strong>.</p>

<p>Most skills can reach a maximum level of 9, with others limited to 3&ndash;6. Certain tiers of a specific skill are only unlocked once the character reaches the level of the tier. Characters can reach a maximum level of 99, although this takes an obscene amount of time &ndash; even with decent Savvy &ndash; and will never be reached by any sane person before they complete the singleplayer storyline.<sup><a href="#fn-maximum-level">17</a></sup></p>

<p>There are five classes in the game:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Paladin (male, melee &amp; ranged)</li>
	<li>Muscleman (male, melee)</li>
	<li>Assassin (female, melee &amp; ranged)</li>
	<li>Wizard (male, caster)</li>
	<li>Witch (female, caster)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each class has three variants with different traits. All effects of a trait are amplified with the character's level. Variants with an elemental trait increase XAP of the element and XDP of the element it restricts, but decrease XDP of its restrictor. For example, for every level an Earth-traited character gains, their EAP and WDP increase, but their NDP decreases. XAP gain varies with the variant, but XDP increases and decreases by 10.</p>

<h4 id="class-paladin">Paladin<a class="para-ref" href="#class-paladin"></a></h4>

<p>The Paladin uses swords, shields, dagger-axes (like a sword attached to an axe handle), and bows. Because the skillset is geared towards swords, bows are not very useful and tend to be a waste of time (especially in singleplayer, where Fusu generally needs to be the strongest character).<sup><a href="#fn-paladin-bows">18</a></sup> The skillset includes an EAP buff and its forging skill (covered shortly) allows the Paladin to craft items instead of paying gold to a blacksmith. Base attributes are: 30 Str, 30 Con, 25 Dex, 30 Sav, 40 Cha, 25 Wis. Variants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Defense [144+33 HP, 140+4 MP, +5 CDP, +5 XDP (all)]:
	<p>Gains XDP, CDP, and extra HP. Should focus on Str and Dex or Str, Con, and Dex. With good block rate and defense skill utilization, this variant makes a good tank.</p></li>

	<li>Offense [120+28 HP, 140+4 MP, +0.8/1.6 CAP]:
	<p>Gains CAP. Often used for PvP; should focus on Str and Dex.</p></li>

	<li>Earth [120+28 HP, 140+4 MP, +0.8/1.6 EAP, +10 WDP, -10 NDP]:
	<p>Earth-traited. Rarely used in multiplayer due to dangerous Wood (and thus poison) weakness. Should focus mostly on Wis.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Fusu is a Paladin of the first variant, which also happens to be the most over-powered class variant in the game.</p>

<p>The Assassin is an offensive trap-laying, stealth-employing dagger, bow, and crossbow wielder who can attack very fast with all weapons except for the crossbow (outside of rapid-fire skills). The skillset includes WAP &amp; NAP buffs, is almost equally divided between daggers &amp; bows, and can be critical in singleplayer due to trap detection and disarm skills.

<p>The gameplay itself is not too different from <em>Baldur's Gate</em>. Anyone familiar with RPGs should find it welcoming. The elements make for a fun build challenge, and your characters' restrictors can become serious sources of fear.</p>

<p>Keys Q, W, E, and R can be bound to attack skills for the primary slot (default attack; left mouse button), whereas keys A, S, D, and F can be bound to all skills for the secondary slot (right mouse button).</p>

<p>Unlike most ARPGs, the camera is independent of the character(s) position and the player can pan around the map freely. Multiple characters can be selected by clicking and dragging over the characters in the game world, or individually by selecting portraits from the character bar or with keys 1&ndash;5. Each character has their own inventory and the player has a single stash. Items can be moved directly between characters by dropping them on portraits in the character bar.</p>

<p>Characters can be moved individually around the map, similar to <em>Baldur's Gate</em>. Due to fog of war (black &amp; soft), it can be useful to send a scout ahead.</p>

<hr class="separator-inner">

<p>Once a character is attacking an enemy, they will continue to attack automatically using the current skill in the primary slot. In singleplayer, the character will also pick a new target automatically, which is very necessary when juggling up to five characters. The game can be paused to queue up the next action, although there is no indication of which action will be performed once the game is unpaused (much unlike <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a>).</p>

<p>Combat is initially slow due to low-grade weapons with low attack speed and doesn't become too fast as the player advances (especially in singleplayer). Some classes, such as the Muscleman, are slower than others, but make up for it in offensive or defensive power &mdash; or, conversely, are faster but more weak. The Paladin, of course, ignores all of this balance nonsense and runs around like he owns the place.</p>

<p>Narrative choices are presented in a textual dialog box which unfortunately requires use of the mouse.

<p>Another fancy mechanic is crafting, which is only accessible through NPC blacksmiths and Paladins (with the ‘Art of forging’ skill). Crafting combines materials to create equipment of nearly any type. In singleplayer this extends to some unwearable items for quests.</p>

<p>Flesh-based material &ndash; tendon, bone, and skin &ndash; can be looted from nearly every non-human mob, whereas ore and wood have to be gathered from sparsely-marked rocks and trees. High stat (Dex especially) and movement speed materials were especially coveted and endlessly hunted down.</p>

<p><em>Prince of Qin</em> skips the part where materials have to be processed (much unlike <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online"><em>Ultima Online</em></a>) and simply combines the attributes of the materials (with a chance of extra random attributes being added). The item level of the crafted equipment depends on the item level of the materials and the skill level of the crafter, which is only a maximum of 6 for Paladins. Due to this, players would use the blacksmith in multiplayer Xianyang, which is slightly better than a maxed Paladin.</p>

<p>Crafters can also inlay gems in main equipment items. Crafted equipment are limited to one socket whereas store-bought equipment can have a maximum of three. An early-patched bug with crafting was exploited to inlay an unlimited number of materials in an item, leading to exceedingly powerful equipment.</p>

<p><em>Prince of Qin</em> is commonly considered an ARPG, but I find some fault with this label &mdash; or at least in its ‘pure’ sense, even though ARPG is not tightly defined. Rather, <em>Prince of Qin</em> is somewhere in-between ARPG (such as the famed <em>Diablo</em> series) and traditional CRPG (such as <em>Baldur's Gate</em><sup><a href="#fn-baldurs-gate">20</a></sup>) with its pacing. Auto-attack really reinforces that point. Players coming from a fast-paced game like <em>Diablo II</em> can cause <em>Prince of Qin</em> to feel sluggish. On the other hand, it employs powerful items and attributes (especially through crafting), following the nature of ARPGs from its time period (which undeniably includes <em>Diablo II</em>).</p>

<p>Several classes can move about swiftly through skills, but it only really becomes ARPG-like in multiplayer, where movement speed is more accessible and where PvP garners a different kind of attention and discipline. On that note, multiplayer might've never happened if it weren't for crafting, which is notably absent in any ARPG from that period (as far as I'm aware). <em>Prince of Qin</em>'s real downfall comes from its bugs and neglected player base. <em>Diablo II</em>, on the other hand, still has a large following to this day; its purity and innovation in the way of the ARPG has certainly served it well.</p>

<p>Despite all of its problems, it still stands as an excellently-crafted RPG in my eye. The artwork direction, music, story, and fantasy are infallibly fitting to its setting. Had it simply received better translation and voice acting, it would stand a bit more prominently as a relic today &mdash; although it certainly deserves a crusade against the more heinous bugs.</p>


<h2 id="intravenous-rpg" class="separator">Intravenous RPG<a class="para-ref" href="#intravenous-rpg"></a></h2>

<p>So, how did this attachment begin?</p>

<p>For me, it all began during the latter snow-covered months of 2002. My brother and I were scouring the net for demos to play (as was our wont) and found the multiplayer demo. It only had access to two classes up to a level cap of 5, which restricted us to the starting city (Yangzhou) and two enemy maps.</p>

<p>We were obsessed. We played numerous characters to the level cap with excitement, despite there not being anything to actually accomplish or explore in our limited play zone. The true factors of interest escape my memory, but they were likely due to the excellent ancient Chinese aesthetic and my love of role-playing (which <em>Prince of Qin</em> is very responsible for extending).</p>

<p>The control over agency and narrative branching in RPGs has always been appealing. When combined with attribute and ability customization (as the label "RPG" now almost universally assumes), these games can become incredible time sinks, despite often lacking any actual designed goal beyond the story (if there is one). In <em>Prince of Qin</em>'s multiplayer (which dominated our time), there certainly wasn't one.</p>

<p>The aesthetic captured ancient China like I'd never seen before &mdash; and since. My exposure to MMORPGs at the time was very minimal, if at all, and in the later years I was always disappointed by the aesthetics of Asian-themed MMOs. They were tacky and lackluster. Even Object Software's later games &ndash; specifically, <em>Seal of Evil</em> and <em>World of Qin 2</em> &ndash; began to slip away. As soon as realtime 3D was utilized, the magic was lost.</p>

<p>Many polygons have to be pushed to contend with the quality of pre-rendered 3D art and tailored 2D art (especially highly detailed background art, such as <em>Prince of Qin</em>'s). Back then, consumer hardware certainly couldn't handle such density, so developers of 2.5D games were limited to high-quality (but inflexible) pre-rendered 3D or low quality (but flexible) realtime 3D. I didn't understand the move to realtime 3D when its quality was so severely limited, but I digress.</p>

<p>Looking back, it's strange that I got hooked so easily. Nowadays story tends to hold more weight than aesthetic as a requirement of my interest. This is possibly due to disappointments over the years more than anything else.</p>

<p>Christmas of 2002, we asked for and received the full game as a gift. We peeked under the wrapping and were driven mad because we weren't allowed to open it until Christmas day. There's a lesson for you, kids: don't peek.</p>

<p>Despite numerous bugs and exploits, the official multiplayer servers were a blast. “Stacking”, a prominent exploit, involved the combination of equipment through a bug with the stacking mechanic intended for medicine items. The combined attributes of the stack would apply to your character when you wore it.</p>

<p>One particular attribute, movement speed, was a big target for stackers. This attribute was rare to come by, and the store-bought items were low level and otherwise of low grade. Because the exploit utilized items that required attributes above the character's base attributes, it was a challenge to find and create items to reach the movement speed cap &mdash; but reach it we did.</p>

<p>Movement speed was of particular interest to hunters, who wanted to do “mat runs” faster. There are very few hunting maps for end-game players, and they were often a point of contention in the community due to the relatively long refresh cycle of material sources.</p>

<p>Soon after we started playing, I sucked two of my cousins and a friend into the game. For all its glory, multiplayer only lasted about two years. The game undoubtedly suffered due to the release of <em>World of Qin</em>. Patching stopped near the end of 2004 with version 1.30 as Object Software jumped ship to online-only games. In quelling exploits like stacking and the demo level glitch, the patches ruined some fundamental mechanics.</p>

<p>The probabilities of accuracy and dodging were effectively useless somewhere in patches 1.22-1.28, and chat message length was reduced to 30 characters in patch 1.30, effectively ruining interaction. Server instability rose and most of the players moved on.</p>

<p>Strategy First kept the servers up for a short while into the end of 2004, but there were very few consistent players. Once the servers shut down, we started our own server.</p>


<h2 id="interim-shimmers-of-fun" class="separator">Interim: shimmers of fun<a class="para-ref" href="#interim-shimmers-of-fun"></a></h2>

<p>Our first dedicated server started in December 2004. I can't recall the patch we used, but stacking was certainly possible &mdash; I remember having “server maintenance” where we inspected the players' characters for signs of stacking.</p>

<p>This died down after only a few months. Stability in general was always rather poor for non-Battle.Net servers (and even then&hellip;). Unlike Battle.Net, private dedicated servers kept items in the world indefinitely instead of deleting them after some matter of minutes. Because of this, our server had to be restarted frequently to avoid bogging down the game.</p>

<p>In October 2006, we came back as the “Legend Server” and were a bit more clever. Utilizing my adventures in programming (which I only started in February 2005), we released a user patch (1.0, map fix, 1.1a) with a terrible hand-written installer which mixed various official patches to quell map issues. We also created a launcher to check server status and to login <em>using a password</em> (albeit in a fake manner &mdash; to this day the actual password handling has not been figured out).</p>

<p>I have no idea how long this run lasted, but it was likely around the same amount of time as the first one. It's possible that it extends into what I'm calling the third run in 2007, but due to no activity in my archives during the interim, I find that unlikely.</p>

<p>In November 2007, we started up the Legend Server again. This saw LS patch 2.0 and an updated launcher, but probably only lasted a few months. There was another likely-short run in October 2008 which saw no increase in the level of cleverness.</p>

<p>Finally in March 2009, after a culmination of over 4 years of programming knowledge, I built a passthrough server to handle authentication and we started our fourth run. We also updated the LS patch to 2.1 &amp; 2.2 and rebuilt the launcher. If I recall correctly, we were using a base patch that fixed stacking, but the LS patch was still incorporating multiple official patches.</p>

<p>Since then, we have not run another server. You might've noticed a pattern with the months we were running: mostly late in the year. I think this is due to the mood we had when we first started playing the game and the ever-vehement nostalgia we felt when reminiscing. It is no coincidence that I am writing this at the end of September.</p>

<p>Throughout 2010, I was deeply invested in deciphering data formats and the network protocol. During my investigations on <em>World of Qin</em>, I eventually got my hands on actual production server software, although it took a few long nights to decipher the poorly-translated Chinese instructions to get it working. This led to the discovery of the command system in <em>Prince of Qin</em> (as well as <em>World of Qin</em>) and the set of XOR ciphers for data and the network protocol (yes&hellip; XOR).</p>

<p>With that information, I was designing passthrough servers to inspect the actual messages the client and server were sending to better implement authentication, but these weren't completed. I moved on to greater things and am currently invested in sorting out my own future.</p>


<h2 id="undying-or-undead" class="separator">Undying, or undead?<a class="para-ref" href="#undying-or-undead"></a></h2>

<p>It's been nearly <em>eleven years</em> since our first encounter. In the past three years alone I've grown my knowledge more than in the remaining eight of that span. In 2010, everything started to click together and I finally feel that I've become a decent programmer. I don't know where I would be without <em>Prince of Qin</em> as a source of inspiration and as an enigma to study. I suspect something else would have taken its place &ndash; to largely <em>waste</em> my youth &ndash; but such theorizing is often fruitless.</p>

<p>The least I want to do is enshrine the game (especially its media) on the net. I have a wealth of information about the game and its various backend systems that can show where Object Software failed and where they succeeded. For now that consists of this article; later I will collect the information on my homesite.</p>

<p>I don't quite know what lies ahead for the game itself, but I have plenty of ideas. Ideally I'd just remake it. There're so many issues that it'd just be better to start over. But time is against me. An obsession such as this doesn't pay the bills; I have employment to worry about before I can do anything substantial, and even then&hellip;</p>

<p>As far as that unrealistic future goes, I'd start with UI handling and scene rendering (the latter of which I've <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/hkwMj9R.jpg">done</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/HCOvJcN.jpg">before</a>). The largest remaining mess of an enigma is animation, so I'd tackle that and move on to actor rendering and dynamics. It's probably a good idea to maintain legacy support, so I'd have to implement the command system as well. The network protocol carries the commands verbatim, which explains lag with more than a handful of players (over, you guessed it, TCP/IP), but it shouldn't be hard to translate to a more compact serialized form later on.</p>

<p>Actually, all of the data formats are rather creepy. It's probably a good idea to rework the asset system and just upconvert everything to new formats.</p>

<p>Or I could ignore the presentational stuff and go straight to the logic with a server and local translator. The server could implement its own compact network protocol and the translator would sit locally and convert between the legacy protocol and the new protocol. That'd be a cheaper way to handle authentication, actually.</p>

<p>But I'm not too interested in preserving multiplayer at this point. Being able to play singleplayer on modern systems without annoyance is more important. On that note, I'd also love to do an LP of the game. It'd force me to actually complete singleplayer and I'd get to document the entire game. That'd be a lot of fun. Maybe I'll do it when I'm old and grumpy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have enough information on hand to make easy mods. I've been fantasizing about making multiplayer obscenely difficult &mdash; maybe increase the enemy count, increase their stats, elemental effect chance, etc. Just for kicks. Maybe dabble in some custom maps, too. It'd also be nice to hack in a windowed mode.</p>

<p>Or&hellip; perhaps no future? All this thinking about <em>Prince of Qin</em> is giving me more ideas for an RPG I've been mulling over. My attachment to <em>Prince of Qin</em> fueled a major growth period through 2006&ndash;2010 (although dwarfed by 2010&ndash;present), but I think I've just about reached the limit of gain.</p>

<p>Remaking anything with a critical eye can be instructive and full of lessons, but not too many people care about the game. I'd just be gratifying myself. All of my game ideas are more compelling than spending countless hours peering into the bit ether and making divinations. Not to mention designing my own systems would be faster than deciphering existing ones.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that <span title="magic wavy hands">the law</span> frowns upon such things. Frankly, it's all rather irrational. Yet here I am.</p>

<p>Which is to say, who knows?</p>

<p>What do a rubber ducky, a pack of chewing gum, a crummy bottle of gin, and a balloon emblazoned with ‘SCIENCE!’ have in common? Merla hasn't the slightest idea, nor is she wondering. No, instead she is baffled by the price of this run-of-the-mill rubber ducky she just purchased for $8.68. At a <em>gas station.</em></p>

<p>“Wait. Why is the gas station selling rubber duckies in the first place?”</p>

<p>She considered diving into this monumental question, but the present danger of her head imploding was more concerning than both the evil pricing policies of International Rubber Ducky Incorporated and the gas station's questionable stock.</p>

<p>“Ughh, headaches are THE WORST.”</p>

<p>Merla began the trek back to her apartment. Not ten minutes pass before she realizes she looks like a homeless drunkard with her over-sized hoodie, scraggly hair, and alcoholic beverage. If not for <em>the balloon</em>. It's going more for ‘druggie’ with that touch. It's amazing what the smallest thing can do. The rubber ducky, or Mr. Duckster, as Merla has already dubbed him, is of no consequence to this image as he is safely snuggled up in the hoodie's muff.</p>

<p>The phone. It's ringing. Samantha. Of course it is.</p>

<p>She answers the call: “Yelloo.”</p>

<p>“Dude. What are you up to?”</p>

<p>“I am doing all of the things, and I don't know what any of them are. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Dez and I are heading to Quiddlopolis. Care to join?”</p>

<p>“<em>Again?</em> What is Dez arting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the usual: dragons and strife.”</p>

<p>“I 'unno. The thought of free food is tempting, but this headache is in full opposition.”</p>

<p>“Did Amer cook for you again? You shouldn't let him do that.”</p>

<p>“That wasn't his fault. And no, I think it's just work.”</p>

<p>“Well, we'll be there all night.”</p>

<p>“I won't promise anything, but save me some dumplings.”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>And that was that. There are still quite a few blocks to go before the homestead.</p>

<p>“Why did I have to go all the way to the gas station!? &hellip; Owwww!”</p>

<p>Yelling: not the best idea for a headache. Especially not at night on a creepy street. Yes, we all know what happens next. It's the best trope there is: a mugger. Don't worry, she has experience with this. I think.</p>

<p>Punk is wearing a black hoodie with black sweatpants. He must be new to this. Coppers'll stop you just for wearing that getup. Anyway, he's ahead of Merla, at the corner of a typical street-side brick building, with a street lamp giving him more shadow than is necessary. Despite the punk being clearly suspicious, Merla is oblivious and preoccupied with her imploding brains.</p>

<p>“Yo, girl,” punk says in a low tone as she comes within some seven steps, “need some crackajacks?”</p>

<p>“Wha?”</p>

<p>“Some crackajacks. Y'know, Big Jack's crackerjacks.”</p>

<p>“Is this happening right now? Are you seriously trying to sell me drugs?”</p>

<p>“C'mon girl, you look so down. I think you could use a little pick-me-up.”</p>

<p>“It's the balloon, isn't it?”</p>

<p>“I'll give you a discount.”</p>

<p>“I don't want any ‘crackajacks’, man.”</p>

<p>“You don't know it yet, baby, but y' <em>do</em>.”</p>

<p>“My head can't take this anymore.”</p>

<p>“Aw girl, you got a headache? Why didn't you say so? I got something for that.”</p>

<p>“Dude. Just touch me already so I claim self-defense when the cops buzz me about a severe case of <em>crackerjack'd bones</em>.”</p>

<p>“Woah girl, relax, ain't no one wanna get hurt here. You don't need nothin', alright, I respect that. Let me know if you ever do tho', I'll give your beauty a discount any time.”</p>

<p>“Don't bet on it.”</p>

<p>Well, I don't know what you think, but I think that went better than anyone expected. Merla trods past the remaining blocks back to her apartment complex.</p>

<p>She shuffles up to the 3rd floor, swings her door open and loudly exclaims: “HONEY, I'M HOME.”</p>

<p>Amer leans back from the computer desk to peer into the doorway, pushing his glasses up his nose to counter gravity. “Excellent.” Several already-disgruntled neighbors bang on the wall, yell back, and/or shoot death stares out their doors as Merla walks into her apartment.</p>

<p>Placing the crummy bottle of gin (balloon anchored underneath) and gum on a table, she flops down on the couch with a voluminous exhale. “Owww.” Amer pops out of the chair.</p>

<p>“I know you don't want to tell me <em>why</em> you need that stuff, but why didn't you just get it yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yet another thing I don't want to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever. You owe me.” Merla is now playing with Mr. Duckster. How squeaky he is!</p>

<p>“Yes&hellip;”</p>

<p>“What's next for mystery night?”</p>

<p>“That one I actually <em>can't</em> tell you. &hellip; The gas station sells rubber duckies?”</p>

<p>“Apparently. Meet Mr. Duckster. He was like ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“Obscene.” Amer has now opened the gin and walked to the window.</p>

<p>“Indeed.”</p>

<p>Amer opens the window and pours about half of the gin out the window. Merla sits up, wondering what in the hell he is doing.</p>

<p>“What in the hell are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I defer to the balloon.”</p>

<p>The balloon. Where has the balloon gone? Ah, it is now directly above Merla, face-down, with the string in her hair. ‘SCIENCE!’ She sighs and lays back down on the couch. Amer sits down at the computer, leaving the bottle of gin open on the computer desk.</p>

<p>“Sam and Dez are at Quiddlopolis tonight.”</p>

<p>“I heard.”</p>

<p>“Are you going?”</p>

<p>“Maybe later. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Only if my brain stops tempting implosion. Oh, and someone tried to sell me drugs on my way back. He was calling me ‘baby’ and ‘girl’ and such.”</p>

<p>“That'll happen. Crackerjacks?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“I just won a bet.” Amer has the grin of a plotter.</p>

<p>“What would that be? Did you just use me for a bet?”</p>

<p>“I will neither confirm nor deny this.”</p>

<p>“Why did you pour gin out the window then?”</p>

<p>“The gin serves other purposes. Which I am still not divulging.”</p>

<p>“Just tell meee.”</p>

<p>“I will not. Where is the change?”</p>

<p>“It's mine. You made me go out there with a monster headache.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough.”</p>

<p>“I'm going to take a shower.”</p>

<p>“'kay.”</p>

<p>Merla throws the hoodie at Amer. He brushes the right sleeve off of his head and continues tappity-tapping away at the computer. Merla disappears into the bathroom.</p>

<p>“Will Mr. Duckster be joining you?” Amer asks loudly, never ceasing the tappity-tap.</p>

<p>“MR. DUCKSTER!” Merla exclaims as she realizes he was forgotten on the couch.</p>

<p>Merla swings open the bathroom door, fetches Mr. Duckster, and then disappears into the bathroom again. During her shower, she sings songs about the adventures of Mr. Duckster that neither you nor Amer could ever hope to understand, so they have been stricken from this narrative.</p>

<p>She emerges some 20 minutes later with a towel wrapped around her from chest to waist. As Amer contemplates his next move, propping his chin against his hand, Merla walks to her dresser.</p>

<p>Amer's focus drifts to Merla at his left as she slips on underwear and undoes her towel.</p>

<p>“I can sense you looking at my bum. Stop it.”</p>

<p>“I would do no such thing” he says drone-like as he ponders this and that.</p>

<p>Merla dons an over-sized t-shirt, walks over to Amer, and shakes his chair.</p>

<p>“Roland made that bet, didn't he?”</p>

<p>“Ludi-crous. Are- you- feeling- any- better- yet?”</p>

<p>“Not really. And why are you wearing my glasses?”</p>

<p>Amer spins around. “Aren't I adorable?” He is trying to look cute to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>“No more than you were” she says as she plucks them away from his face and slides them onto her own.</p>

<p>Merla sits down on the couch and combs her hair. Amer stands, dons the hoodie previously thrown at him, and struggles to chew about six sticks of gum simultaneously. Once at a satisfying consistency, he stabs a small hole in the balloon, squeezes its contents into the gin bottle, quickly clogs the spout with gum, and screws the cap back on. Merla sits slack-jawed wondering again what in the hell he is doing.</p>

<p>He inhales a bit of the helium directly from the balloon and says “I'm going out for a bit.”</p>

<p>“I won't ask. Watch out for the crackerjack dealers.”</p>

<p>“'kay.”</p>

<p>Amer quietly leaves the apartment with helium-gin in hand and bounds down the stairs. Merla watches the balloon slowly deflate and rest on the ground.</p>

<p><em>To be continued&hellip;</em></p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>My projects are rather anomalous. There are few reasons they exist:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I had a curiosity.</li>
	<li>I had a bucket full of spare time.</li>
	<li>I had a need for something (typically becoming generic).</li>
</ol>

<p>That's essentially how it goes for everyone else, right? Right.</p>

<p>New projects involve a bunch of deliberation over design, which, I admit, becomes unhealthy somewhere around the umpteenth pass. Often, a project is left in some manner of limbo, or is never christened with a public shell (which usually comes down to how interesting I find it to be,<sup><a href="#fn-project-interestingness">1</a></sup> regardless of how useful it is). I have learned much through horrible design (specifically: of realizing it after the fact) and I think it is <em>good</em> to fail, but I'm finding it more and more difficult to accept minuscule defects. My scrutiny core won't shutdown. I suspect the cause of this runs deeper than I'm willing to explore at present.</p>

<p>There are also, of course, the distractions. It is easy to get lost in the cornucopia of information that is the Internet.</p>

<p>While I'm here, I'll just get this out of my system: in August 2012 I received an email from a Google recruiter on a hunt. On the face of it, they were likely just flipping through GitHub users, searching for people to fill seats in their new offices, but I digress. The prospect is simultaneously appealing and terrifying. Part of me just wants to experience it, and another part is (very rightly so) screaming “unqualified”.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> significant concerns here. For one, I'm very much the opposite of a web person. I hate web tech; I think it's all schizophrenic.<sup><a href="#fn-schizo-tech">2</a></sup> Even if they're trying to fill a backend position, I'm still not the right person. I'm a sciolist, and I think that was recognized in the mock interview, seeing as they placed me in a pile and want to review my skills at some later date.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think they need to review their rules for probing GitHub.</p>

<p>However, since I have no other foreseeable future, I am somewhat aiming towards this end. If I don't end up with a job: no big deal. It would be a relief, really. And I will have learned a few good things. If I <em>do</em> end up with a job: a kind of validation, in a sense? I can just leave if it's not all it's chalked up to be (which I am highly suspicious about). Maybe this is all self-denial and it doesn't really take a master to fit in at Google. We shall see.</p>

<h2 id="side-b" class="separator">Side B: Goals for 2013<a class="para-ref" href="#side-b"></a></h2>

<p>For one, I want to replace Jekyll, which I loathe greatly. I have a very primordial design in the works, but I haven't decided which charming language to use. It will probably be Go. <em>Not</em> Ruby.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda is to rebuild my log keeper, which is currently hobbled together with Gtk♯ (a notably fickle, possibly dead wrapper). There will be two components to this: a core library and a CLI application. At some point I want to introduce a distributed model.</p>

<p>In the same vein, I want to make a loose time tracker for Android &mdash; either to tie into my <a target="_blank" href="http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/">Hamster</a> database, or to replace it entirely. I hope this does not turn into a Hamster port. Java makes me sad. Python does too, but not as effectively as Java.</p>

<p>Then there's the broker/load distributor/whatchamacallit. Basically, a library (and highly configurable application) for quickly slapping ØMQ schemes together. I'm not really sure why I started this, but it's a fun idea. It's also half-way done.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to clean up and open-source my core game engine. I did a lot of backend work for an RPG &ndash; hardly a sane undertaking &ndash; that is probably useful to some crazy person somewhere.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of other things I'd like to do, but I won't boor this post with them.</p>

<p>“I'm all dried up, Merla; my creative tanks are emptier than&hellip; I can't even come up with a worthy metaphor!” Amer despaired, elbowed over the smoldering tea and rubbing his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Not offering much solace, she replied: “Then why tax yourself in the futile attempt to produce something marginally interesting out of every passing whim?”</p>

<p>“I can't help it. There's always this itch, this nagging voice, but I haven't got the chloroform to silence it. Admittedly, the constant hours tapping away like a dysfunctional woodpecker is like throwing paint at a wall in an attempt to reproduce the Mona Lisa.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“I still think you should take up skydiving” (breaking the silence).</p>

<p>“She's surely annoyed by all this, already &mdash;” he thought, “months of my incessant whining.”</p>

<p>“Actually, I was thinking about doing the whole monk thing &mdash; take up Buddhism or something in a monastery.”</p>

<p>“Haha, that would fit you so well. I'm picturing you in an orange robe, towering over a bunch of little Indian monklings.”</p>

<p>“I've almost convinced myself to do it.” He takes a cautious sip of the tea.</p>

<p>“What's stopping you?”</p>

<p>“My cat. I don't think Samantha would enjoy being stuck with her.”</p>

<p>“I can catsit for you no probs; you'll be back before a fortnight anyways, right?”</p>

<p>“I'm serious. The whole nine, er, gazillion yards.”</p>

<p>“Mmmhm” she murmurs, sipping her latte through one of those bendy straws.</p>

<p>“I don't know how you can stand to drink that. It's full of junk.”</p>

<p>“And your radioactive tea is <em>so</em> much better?” she quips out the side of her straw-occupied mouth, with an accompanying smirk.</p>

<p>Pushing the cup aside and sitting back, he returns with a frown: “Hardly. I'd never believe this stuff is real. It's probably synthesized from fresh refuse &mdash; it's probably <em>worse</em> than radioactive tea.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“Maybe I could take her with me&hellip;” he pondered aloud, though mostly wondering to himself.</p>

<p>“Aah, it's already two-thirty” now rising and glaring at her smartphone. “I've gotta go meet Dez for a wrecking party in her kitchen. We're going to tear the place up &mdash; want to join us?”</p>

<p>“You make physical labor sound <em>so exciting</em>.”</p>

<p>“What can I say? I like smashing things into tiny bits” (dealing a swift phantom-sledgehammer strike to an unknowing patron).</p>

<p>“I'll pass, thanks.”</p>

<p>“You sure? Lots'a fun you're gonna miss out on” (swinging the fearsome sledgehammer to shoulder, showing some brawn).</p>

<p>“As much as I might enjoy splintering Dezora's grimy old cabinets or shattering her creepy floors, I have to catch a very important date with a bench.”</p>

<p>“Don't forget that you're forbidden to frolic in <em>other pastures</em>.”</p>

<p>“Blast! Foiled once again by my quixotic lady and her menacing sledgehammer.”</p>

<p>She salutes with “my pleasure, sir”, turns very martially on point and marches, shadow-sledge still shouldered, out the automatic door.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>After some time in silent musing, thinking it upon himself to inform the liquid-death dispensary of its detestable product, he scribbles on a sliver of paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have you know, waiter or waitress, that this establishment's so-called tea is the most unsavory poison I have ever had the displeasure to measure.</p>
<p>A thousand effervescent toads upon thee!</p>
<p><em>Your's hardly,<br />
an unimpressed patron</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He slips out of his chair, leaving the note folded (but not creased; rather: ready to spring) under the lifeless cup.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Now walking down the street, a Bond tune comes to mind (the signature one); he imagines the Austin Martin now zooming past to be in hot pursuit of some mega-evil villain, but the scene is cut short as the vehicle lurches to a halt on the traffic signal's scarlet command.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>He greets the stone-made bench in usual mental dialogue: “Hello, steadfast park bench; I have come once again to keep you company in the observation of the pedestrians.”</p>

<p>“About time you showed up.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, I was chatting over shabby beverages with Merla” (sitting down).</p>

<p>“Lovely, I am sure. The old duck lady is here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see that. Ever busy poisoning them with peanut butter.”</p>

<p>“And &ndash; look &ndash; that guy with the bulldog. His vagrant beast urinated <em>and</em> defecated on my foot the other day.”</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>Amer shifts to the left side of the bench. “Disgusting creatures.”</p>

<p>“Veritably.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“So, how're things?”</p>

<p>“Still haven't gotten a bath; that voracious maple continues to uproot the path stones, unabated; ever more chilled sugar spilled topside, ample gum plating underside; and the skateboard kid still hops all over me every weekday morning &mdash; someday I'll spontaneiate a pair of fists and clock 'em in the groin. &hellip; But you <em>know</em> nothing ever really changes around here.”</p>

<p>“Silly of me to ask.”</p>

<p>“How's that creative block treating you?”</p>

<p>“Lost on the 87th avenue &mdash; I've become quite familiar with the place.”</p>

<p>“That bad, eh? Maybe you should take up skydiving.”</p>

<p>“Second time today I've heard that suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like a bit of drop-yourself-to-the-Earth to invigorate the mind juices.”</p>

<p>“If only one could have a chance at missing.”</p>

<p>“You're always like this.”</p>

<p>“It's my nature.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“Something has been bothering me.”</p>

<p>“What would that be?”</p>

<p>“I can't figure out how I ended up being surrounded by women. I literally have no dude friends.”</p>

<p>“That's because you're so damn charming, Amer.”</p>

<p>“I don't buy it. Maybe it's because I've been around Merla so much, they think I'm fun to be around and, by peer review, suitably uncreepy for friendship?”</p>

<p>“My faculties don't go so far as relationship advice, Amer. I am only a bench.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“The Emersons! Quick, feign slumber! Ah, wait, that may make them more concerned&hellip;”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten? They haven't really bothered me since the marble incident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, right. They're still quite bitter about that, by the way.”</p>

<p>“Just nod and smile, nod and smile.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>“Amer, I've been doing some thinking.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? About that manly statue taunting you, again?”</p>

<p>“No. I <em>was</em> thinking &hellip; that maybe we shouldn't hang out anymore. You're not helping your situation by moping around with me. You should be with Merla, enjoying the kind of life I'm physically unable to attain. Plus, I'm literally three times your age.”</p>

<p>“Oh hey, Merla just sent me a message. It's &hellip; oh wow, she wasn't kidding. That is an <em>obliterated</em> countertop.”</p>

<p>“You're not listening to me.”</p>

<p>“All ears; please, continue.”</p>

<p>“You can't keep living like this. You've got to pick yourself up at some point &mdash; and your cousin isn't going to endure your presence forever, you know.”</p>

<p>“Actually, Sam quite likes my cooking. Would you kick a free chef out the door?”</p>

<p>The bench pretends to not hear Amer's deflection: “And what if I'm the cause of your deficiency?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to think that you're helping me with me with it.”</p>

<p>“You see the same shit here every week, Amer. I don't think you can glean anything more from the plebeians &mdash; they're more pitiful than you are.”</p>

<p>“I'd hardly say so. Ol' granny has an ingeniously sinister plan to eradicate the ducks, ultimately converting the carpet of feces to a smattering of expired duck carcasses; that fat guy is actually losing some weight; and &hellip; Yeah, maybe you are right.”</p>

<p>“At last, you see reason.”</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Amer stands and arches his back in a stretch. “I think I <em>shall</em> take some time away from the park.”</p>

<p>“Good. But before you leave me to the bitter-cold canopy of night, pray do try to convince the park-keeper to give me a thorough washing, won't you please?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>Amer saunters over to the park's shed and scrawls onto found parchment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dearest gentle park-keeper, I come to you in such an utterly sorry, desolate state with one humble request: that I, the last hope for exhausted man-legs, should receive the same tender care as the stones on which they tread &mdash; namely: a power-washing.</p>
<p>Also, a strategically-placed sign that reads ‘HOW DARE YOU SKATE ON THIS BENCH, MISCREANT!’ would, I imagine, work well to put an end to the inexcusable crimes of a certain punk-ass kid. Just a suggestion.</p>
<p><em>Questioning the judgment backing his placement near such a menacing maple tree and aching in disgusting grime,<br />
a park bench</em></p>
<p>P.S. Make sure you scrape off all the gum on my belly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then, with pocketed hands, headed off towards Samantha's house. The Sun was setting.</p>

<p>This TED Radio Hour talks to TED speakers Sir Ken Robinson, Salman Khan and John Hunter.</p>

<p>I will remark on them in reverse, starting (obviously) with John Hunter. His game of politics reminds me of an unrelated Grenada invasion reenactment covered in an episode of This American Life.<sup><a href="#fn-tal-grenada-reenactment">1</a></sup> They could stand to learn a lesson or two from Hunter: they insist the decisions of the past were correct, rather than allowing the children to figure it out without assistance or immediate judgment. Hunter, on the other hand, gives them a world much like ours and says, “Here're the keys to the missile silos (and everything else). Do as you please and we'll discuss the outcomes later.”</p>

<p>Secondly: Salman Khan, the creator of Khan Academy.<sup><a href="#fn-khan-academy">2</a></sup> If you don't know who he is or what Khan Academy is by now, frankly I am appalled.</p>

<p>Thirdly: Sir Ken Robinson, whose talks<sup><a href="#fn-ken-robinson-talks">3</a></sup> I somehow missed. He expands upon them in the podcast, so I won't offer anything except this: <em>I agree with him entirely</em>.</p>

<p>Before I scamper off with my virtual visage, I must share the end to his second talk: a poem by Yeats with a very poignant addition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,<br />
Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br />
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br />
Of night and light and the half-light,<br />
I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br />
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br />
I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br />
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</em><sup><a href="#fn-yeats-poem">4</a></sup></p>
<p>And everyday, everywhere, our children spread their dreams beneath our feet, and we should tread softly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, the link excerpt:</p>

<blockquote class="excerpt">


<p class="normal-inset">“There's a terrible tendency to confuse raising standards with standardizing.”<br>&mdash; Sir Ken Robinson</p>

<p>We know getting a good education is important, but does the current model nurture real learning? Here, we look at powerful ideas on how to change education: flipping classrooms, rethinking lesson plans and re-imagining the role of teacher and student.</p>

<h2 id="preface" class="separator">Preface: the history of these ~1.4kg of matter<a class="para-ref" href="#preface"></a></h2>

<p>As I write this, I am going through a phase of self-reeducation. My childhood was incredibly wasted, mostly through the lack of sensible guidance and through my own blindness (which can, I think, be excused: the adolescent mind, as I will later posit, primarily mirrors and expounds upon experience and observation &mdash; in other words, the mind is almost wholly shaped by its environment: the people ‘teaching’ it and the things it observes and experiences).</p>

<p>To give this article some context and to illustrate why I think certain things are essential, I shall give a brief history of my own childhood.</p>

<p>I grew up in a strict Presbyterian household (though I have little to relate to, I would consider it more or less typically strict) with four siblings: a younger brother, an older sister, an olderer brother, and an oldest sister. My parents switched from some other Christian denomination when I was probably around the age of 8; thus, Presbyterianism is more of my conscious life than any other religion. My eldest sister and brother started in public school but were soon moved to homeschooling for (I am roughly certain) religious and societal reasons (something like “those horrible children in public school will corrupt them!” never minding the deficiencies that could result from peerless lives).</p>

<p>I found the religion's people to often be mindless, scandalous, and quick to judge and anger &mdash; unlike their Christ and the edicts of their bible. I find the existence of a god just as absurd as the prerequisites for a certain scientific theory: ultimately, something &ndash; a god, a gravitational singularity &ndash; from nothing. Neither religion nor science can explain how anything at all could possibly exist in the first place &mdash; which is admittedly futile, but there I stand: at odds with the reality of existence.</p>

<p>My parents claim to have developed us as free thinkers (I at least give them an iota of credit for the <em>outcome</em>, something <em>we</em> have achieved by <em>their inaction</em>), yet they never illustrated different modes of thought. Their approach to this appears to be one of ignorance to the concept: fallacies must be smothered; hold stereotypical prejudice against others for their beliefs or ideals; berate offspring for expressing radical thought or being unable to do as demanded; and so on &mdash; instead of reasoning against fallacies, teaching objectivity or exemplifying free-mindedness. Truly Christ-like, I contest.</p>

<p>At home we were restricted to some small number of hours for television (thankfully; what a crock of rubbish it is) and around the same for computer use; media ratings were followed by-the-letter with some extra; being up past bedtime was a no-no and we were of course punished for sneaking onto the computers at night (I will talk about these later; having a gravity towards something can lead to good, even if that something is entertainment media &mdash; in the least, absorbing culture is generally good, though I offer the distinction to ‘corruption via corrupt culture’). If we refused to get out of bed for church on Sabbath, we were punished by being (figuratively) locked in our rooms all day, prevented from doing nearly anything, and were not allowed to visit our grandparents (visiting was and still is a sort of tradition on Sundays) &mdash; which was the only other place we (I, specifically) (sometimes grimly) gained an iota of social experience.</p>

<p>My younger brother and I were educated exclusively at home. Unfortunately, the sciences &ndash; actually, all topics &ndash; were strewn with misplaced religious justifications and censorship of and adversity to natural knowledge (for example: plain human anatomy and biology &mdash; dare they see a naked human body or learn of the functions of their own species!<sup><a href="#fn-savage-sex-ed">1</a></sup>), which made them an incredible bore (I do not intend to imply that any non-religiously-mangled book will immerse a child, merely that religion detracted immensely from my interest in every one). I was stuck in 3rd-grade mathematics (the same exact textbook) for <em>more than two years</em> simply because I was unable to understand the concepts and my mother and father, both possessing only sullied high-school educations, were unable or unwilling to assist (I remember verbal abuse and fits of rage from my mother due to being unable to progress &mdash; due to being unwilling to stare at books I didn't understand). My curiosity was left unsatiated and insulted; my will to learn diminished.</p>

<p>Despite being very good at spelling, I never got anywhere with grammar; I attribute this primarily to the lack of peers with which to communicate. We were given the opportunity to take art classes headed by someone from our church, but it did not interest either of us (I now firmly believe that artistic expression should be required in early education). Music was the same: an <em>expensive</em> offer and &ndash; to some little squirts who just wanted to decimate some AI in Age of Empires or build stuff in the woods &ndash; it also wasn't very interesting (again: even if it isn't carried on, music should be experimented with to profile the young mind; I now have immense interest in both art and music but no grounds to build on).</p>

<p>Curiosity was not very well tended to, though I imagine it was more so than in most settings. It was not restricted, but it wasn't really facilitated either. From toying with electronics, I learned: what certain chemicals and corrosions smell like and how to use a soldering iron and other tools; from building stuff, I understand: structural integrity and the properties of various materials; from playing with video games and computers, I learned: programming, data forms, the concepts of cryptography and data compression, the methodologies of reverse engineering, networking protocols, and general logic (all of which developed into quite a capable skillset).</p>

<p>Despite a mild rise in yearly test scores as I completed my canonical education, I never felt as though I'd learned anything from it: I certainly never learnt any of the sciences (my scores illustrated that <em>gracefully</em>), my math fundamentals were never ingrained, and I never grasped the technicalities of English. It felt as though I were remembering particulars simply to pass the test, on which I scored poorly. I've learned far more about language through observation and far more about mathematics through Khan Academy<sup><a href="#fn-khan-academy">2</a></sup> than I ever did from textbooks.</p>

<p><strong>In short, my education was a failure</strong>; the approach taken and lack of guidance and instruction piled high my disdain for it all. By the time I was into my early- and mid-teens I was consigned to ‘teaching’ myself from books that were higher than my understanding, though of appropriate &ndash; or worse &ndash; grade level for my age (this is a very bad state which should be avoided: it results foremost in laziness &ndash; especially if the student's work is not checked &ndash; and a feeling that everything is a Mt. Everest to surmount when nothing is understood). Coinciding with this was an avalanche of introversion (no friends in our elderly neighborhood, and of course no classmates to collude with) and a much slower decline in the anger shown by my parents in all regards (I've seen this curious effect also in their siblings and I might write on it in the future; it may be that they have finally realized the mortality of humanity).</p>

<p>It became increasingly evident that my parents cared little about our education. My work was rarely (if ever) checked, and I devolved into laziness and putting off study since I deemed it all hopeless. I'm fairly certain my brother stopped doing anything for his final two years &mdash; they didn't enforce it, became angry when they noticed, and quickly returned to not enforcing it. If knowledge isn't given, it will be sought and found elsewhere &mdash; and, for the educator, likely in places and forms he does not think highly of.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this, my digital life and interest in computers grew and grew. Video games were an escape from reality; from the get-go I marveled at their complexity and conceptualized how they could possibly work. This led to data inspection, manipulation, and computer programming, which I dipped into around the age of 13 with BASIC derivatives. In-between the frustrations of life, I would play real-time strategy, role-playing and (once I was permitted to do so) first-person shooter games, reverse-engineer (some of) them, and do mad experiments with code &mdash; building my understanding of computer internals and programming (almost entirely with the aid of nary a book<sup><a href="#fn-programming-books">3</a></sup>).</p>

<p>I gained (few) friends on the Internet and developed essentially all of my language through communication (mostly textual, though voice chat was often utilized when gaming), reading, and observation (all of which I find to be far more valuable than the cruft in any language textbook).</p>

<p>I am an introvert and can't coherently articulate myself vocally and, in my immediate environment, I learnt early that speaking often leads to more trouble than not speaking &mdash; and, because of this lack of social acumen, my words are not often heeded to when they are spoken. I am critical of everything and far more observant to and aware of things which are insignificant or even invisible to others (I generally liken this to hyper-awareness: both a curse and a useful trait). I don't share my projects or ideas with most of my family because of the hyperbole I get in return (positive or negative criticality: detested likewise) and because they rarely understand.</p>

<p>I absolutely do not understand nor accept emotion and it has given way to realism and pessimism (if I am not failing in memory, more than once have I been described as ‘an emotionless husk,’ which is <em>beautifully</em> accurate). I hide behavior which I believe others will be critical of, or simply because I do not want their opinions. I get lost in lengthy musings and what I call ‘net loops’ (like the well-known ‘Wikipedia loop,’ but within the scope of the entire Internet, though it most often consists of staring at IRC or parsing information that I've already parsed; finally beginning to crush this one) &mdash; both excellently destructive to productivity and focus.</p>

<p>Most telling is my lack of motivation and deficiency of initiative: I still live with my parents, jobless and higher-education-less (it's truly absurd how expensive this stuff is &mdash; and amusingly useless unless you have swimming pools filled to the brim with fiat currency to dish out for the more prestigious establishments, to obtain only a greater title).</p>

<p><strong>My own interest in things not of conventional education is the keystone of what I am today.</strong> I adorably made up for lack of guidance with observation; friends with introspection; education with curiosity. It all depends on the Internet and a very narrow path which I could've easily fallen from. If I had taken a single misstep upon that path or taken an even less-guided one, I would be immensely different and likely far worse off. My path is fragile, stochastic, and <em>unacceptable</em>; an unforgivable outcome requiring leagues of remediation.</p>

<h2 id="introduction" class="separator">Introduction<a class="para-ref" href="#introduction"></a></h2>

<p>This article is mainly based on <strong>my <em>humble</em> ideals and thoughts</strong>; only the bits which have actually aided me will I vet as tested and cromulent &mdash; the rest are informed conjecture. Since I have experienced more failure than success, I am more familiar with what <em>doesn't</em> work; I find that this makes it easier express and understand both spectra. Following that, <strong>I am not the paragon of the ideals I set forth</strong>.</p>

<p>I began writing this months ago as a letter (perhaps more accurately: a plea to avoid my parents' failings) to a relative, but I decided to generalize and expand it for the perceived greater good; keep in mind that it is aimed towards educators (though not specifically of the ‘I went to school for this’ sense).</p>

<p>I've separated it into four parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fundamentals;</li>
	<li>Idealism;</li>
	<li>Edutainment; and finally:</li>
	<li>Reality</li>
</ol>

<p>Last but not least, here be the disclaimers: I am neither teacher nor scientist, and I certainly don't know how to deal with very young children (nor very very old ones, for that matter). If you are hoping I will give you a scientific understanding of psychology, emotion, social intercourse, or how humans learn, you are reading the wrong text. Though I do not wish to garner distaste, this article will not respect society's mannerisms; profanity may be present in quotes (for they are merely words, after all), and I may insult some of your own ideals.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-fundamentals" class="separator">Part 1: Fundamentals<a class="para-ref" href="#part-1-fundamentals"></a></h2>

<p>Fundamentals in my own words are the foundations of competency; the ultimate shapers of the mind. It can be said that ‘in a typical system, <strong>defective input yields defective output</strong>;’ likewise, defective fundamentals result in a defective mind. A good analogy would be: fundamentals are to the mind as yeast are to dough &mdash; when the yeast is dead or absent, the dough doesn't expand; the resulting mass is hard and unsavory.</p>

<h3 id="fundamental-1-freedom">Fundamental 1: Freedom<a class="para-ref" href="#fundamental-1-freedom"></a></h3>

<p>Freedom is what I view as most basic and essential. Children will follow the examples of and strive to be more like the people they look up to (if this fundamental proves anything, let it be that, and extrapolate the rest); therefore, first and foremost, you must be: composed, receptive, and vocal.</p>

<p>Why these things, exactly? I'll tell 'ya.</p>

<p><strong>Composed</strong>: anger and lack of resolve have no place in the educator; these elements of weakness are the first to adversely affect attraction, severe defects of which may eventually lead to detestation. If you can't be composed &ndash; can't act as you'd like the child to &ndash; everything else is of little effect. I know quite well that anger breeds anger: I have a mostly-buried behavior of vocal outburst and criticality in general, instilled by my immediate family and from my childhood.</p>

<p><strong>Receptive</strong>: if the child's ideas and questions are ignored, met with chastisement, or unanswered, he will devolve into silence &mdash; it will appear to him as if undue trouble is brought (to himself and likely to others), so he refrains from speaking. If you listen to the child and engage with him to cooperatively determine the legitimacy of a theory, thought or question, he will learn that voicing them leads to better understanding the world.</p>

<p><strong>Vocal</strong>: <strong>language goes far beyond formal education</strong> &mdash; we are typically exposed to many many facets of language from birth: enunciation, phrase formation, contraction, visual association, cultural quirkiness, etc. Beyond developing the child's language, being vocal will instill enjoyment of expression and a willingness to speak.</p>

<p>Being afraid or unable to express is the greatest deficiency one could have; our ideas are what we make of them, and we oft make of them nothing. If the response to an idea is negative, it will teach a primed mind how to debate and how to improve the idea; if positive, it will teach that expression can result in good and that reward (literal, knowledge, and otherwise) is often received for it.</p>

<p>And here I will introduce our very own devil's advocate; I will call him Ernie. “So, you're saying&hellip; freedom as in let them watch rated-R films, live in automobiles and join a gang &mdash; anything?” Absolutely not, Ernie; that'd be a complete lack of discipline. The freedom I'm arguing for is only to ensure the child is able and willing to express and to question. It is not mutually exclusive to discipline.</p>

<h3 id="fundamental-2-empiricism">Fundamental 2: Empiricism<a class="para-ref" href="#fundamental-2-empiricism"></a></h3>

<p>Our species has only advanced (first) through observation of our environment and (second) through inference upon those observations; we might as well be brainless meat bags if these capacities become undeveloped. Take, for example, our age but without decades of science and reason &mdash; no Galileo, no Tesla, no Einstein, no Industrial Revolution. We would probably still think the Earth is flat, and the stars revolve around us; there would be no computers, and certainly no oil- or electric-powered vehicles &mdash; <strong>we wouldn't have spacecraft on the edge of our <em>solar system</em></strong> (which launched in <strong>1977</strong>)! If I didn't have to argue for freedom (and it's a deplorable fact that I do), the development of empiricism would be most paramount of all.</p>

<p>“But,” Ernie exclaims, “observation and inference come naturally!” Right you are Ernie, but they can be incredibly more acute when coaxed and will flourish especially when the previous fundamental is followed.</p>

<p>Children should be taught immediately to deductively reason and to scrutinize what society has agreed on. Curiosity and understanding can be amplified by asking of them about the world they cannot yet accurately measure &mdash; or think they can, but are coming to malformed conclusions.</p>

<p>Perception will always be warped by education, so let the education be as questioning as they are; human nature is to be curious and to infer: don't tear that away from them.</p>

<h3 id="fundamental-3-morality">Fundamental 3: Morality<a class="para-ref" href="#fundamental-3-morality"></a></h3>

<p>“How exactly do we teach morality to a free mind?” You don't, Ernie; it's not something that should be <em>taught</em>. “That makes no sense.” I will elaborate: it is a fabricated concept of society which is, for a truly free mind, irrelevant &mdash; an intrusion on the mental capacity of the mind. When the mind is free, right and wrong <em>must</em> ultimately be determined by the individual; the arguments of peers are merely points of data in the equation. Everything you teach the child should allow him to define his own morality, rather than it being defined by his generation's culture at every turn.</p>

<p>“Okay; why then is this a fundamental?” To further illustrate a point: that one should facilitate the capacities to come to conclusions &ndash; to debate and question &ndash; rather than institute ‘this is wrong; this is right; do as I do’.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-idealism" class="separator">Part 2: Idealism<a class="para-ref" href="#part-2-idealism"></a></h2>

<p>“I'm raising my son to be a doctor because <em>I'm a doctor</em> and because doctors make lots of money and heal people and stuff.” You disgust me, Ernie; have you learned nothing? “I just want what's best for him!” No, you don't; you want to mold him into something you admire or want for yourself. You are selfish and a perfect example of what's wrong with our culture. “<em>My pleasure.</em>”</p>

<p>If you spawned the child, that doesn't mean you get all the rights to his course of life. If you do it all wrong, he may even despise you for spawning him in the first place. That's really critical, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to illustrate. Why should your ideal life plan be any better than the child's desires? He knows what excites him better than anyone else; allow him to decide his course of life &mdash; after all, isn't that what free-mindedness is all about?</p>

<p>Sure, I have my own ideals &ndash; this article is basically one big ideal &ndash; but I don't try to force others into accepting them; I <em>try</em> to use counterpoints and logic. Perhaps your ideals are formed around your own knowledge &ndash; for example: you know so much about something and want to teach the child about it &ndash; that's <em>excellent</em> and I wholly encourage it (as long as they are interested), but don't do it in the hope that he will one day share your profession, do it to increase his knowledge. That is what every educator should strive to do.</p>

<p>In short: I'm not saying you should throw away your ideals, just don't take away their choice of path.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-edutainment" class="separator">Part 3: Edutainment<a class="para-ref" href="#part-3-edutainment"></a></h2>

<p>None of that ‘education software with game-like crap tacked on’ silliness. I'm talkin' about real video games and other entertainment media being educational and beneficial. I'll start off with something Mike Krahulik said in response to a question about sharing game culture with children and the joys thereof:<sup><a href="#fn-pax-east-2012-krahulik-qa">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>My oldest son is 7 now, and he's 100% hooked on Minecraft. [...] He was playing the other day and he'd built a lighthouse with a glowstone on the top, and I said “Well, that's pretty cool; is there any way that you could make it turn like a lighthouse?” &mdash; that was my sort of challenge to him. He was in there for a couple of hours and when I came back in [...] he had created a system where there were pusher blocks [ED: pistons] in each corner that would push the glowstone from side to side. Each time it went to a different corner, the next block would push it to the next one [and so on]. And it was all built with redstone and trigger plates. ... And I was like, Jesus Christ. I mean, you hear about people saying “Oh you have to limit the amount of time these kids play,” but.. he built a fucking lighthouse! There's no way I'm going to limit that time; absolutely not.</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot to be gained from this which might not be immediately evident: trial and error; understanding of state and continuity; understanding and combination of different materials; etc. And this example only involves the creation of something using game mechanics &mdash; it can go far beyond that: the oft-present numbers meta-game (determining which equipment and abilities will give you the upper hand against a particular opponent; choosing the right group of enemies to fight for the maximum yield &ndash; gold, equipment &ndash; with the lowest cost and difficulty; etc.); in player-versus-player games (especially), prediction and adaptation; devising the technological concepts of the game's innards (this sort of thing came naturally to me after I started programming); and so on. Anyone who has played a game knows how this works or can at least fathom its reality.</p>

<p>I am not advocating limitless entertainment &ndash; which is ultimately what it is &ndash; and I don't believe Krahulik is either &mdash; he is actually distinguishing between worthwhile and extraneous entertainment. Massively multiplayer online (MMO) and FarmVille-esque games (Ernie may argue that it could teach economics or management skills, but I refuse to give it anything) are perhaps the most destructive and wasteful of all, but plenty of dialogue-driven, sandbox, and (<em>actual</em>) puzzle/puzzle-adventure games are incredibly educational. There are certainly many other important things, gaming just shouldn't be tossed aside as the bad apple. A game should be likened to a textbook: only so much can be learned from it; once it has been fully absorbed, others should be used. It is a balancing act.</p>

<p>What of other media? Traditional comics these days are disgraceful (I'm looking at you two, Marvel and DC), but swaths of web comics &ndash; the works of independent artists &ndash; are amazingly imaginative. A similar trend is found with the massive film and video game publishers: they suffer sequelitis and aim for capitalization. They are no longer imaginative and innovative, instead opting to make the quickest and biggest buck, pumping out stale, boorish, malfunctional products every morrow. Independent artists and game developers are often the only ones pushing their mediums, reflective of the dull culture and coming generation of the US; they yearn for better, so they craft it with their own hands.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-reality" class="separator">Part 4: Reality<a class="para-ref" href="#part-4-reality"></a></h2>

<p>I said in the preface I would posit that the adolescent mind “primarily mirrors and expounds upon experience and observation”. I do believe that and I think I've argued my points, but there is more to it. The mind isn't <em>entirely</em> shaped by its environment &mdash; I believe there is still some level of innate ability which science cannot yet explain definitively. Leonardo da Vinci would probably have been as awesome as he was regardless of his path, but we might not have known about him in some of those paths. Perhaps there's an alternate universe where he kept entirely to himself, but had the same ideas: all of that knowledge, all of that genius would be lost. Perhaps he made money by baking the bestest bread in all of Italy instead of painting and inventing.</p>

<p>The state of education in the US is atrocious. The nation is deeply ingrained with fallacies and every facet of the culture reflects that. We are spending billions, even trillions of non-existent money on futile war, and our states are instituting absurd legislature<sup><a href="#fn-nc-sea-level">5</a></sup> &mdash; instead of improving the education of our offspring. Our <em>elected officials</em> toy with the media for their own gain<sup><a href="#fn-gov-media-manipulation">6</a></sup> and consistently show how conflicted they are with their own promises.</p>

<p>The reality is that we can't really predict what our offspring will invent, think, or express; we can only prepare them for the magnificent and horrific world as best we can and hope they make better of it than we have. After all, the future is far more about them than it is about you or I.<sup><a href="#fn-ndt-reddit-ama-kids">7</a></sup></p>

<p>If the human race is to survive into the future, to push the frontier, it needs to be unafraid to see and say it as it is; it needs a strong constitution and a more logical mind. We're doing an incredibly horrible job of planting and cultivating those seeds.</p>

<p>Admittedly, we're not left with much to work with here. If the schools aren't teaching properly, and if homeschooling requires well-versed instructors to be effective, what course can be taken? Society isn't going to instate proper leaders &hellip; well, ever, and education is going to take a long time to improve, if it ever will. You'll have to do the best you can with the resources available.</p>

<p>If you're able to devote all of your energy to educating the child, you should look into homeschooling and perhaps have other well-versed persons teach him in the areas which you're not knowledgeable enough &mdash; just don't forget social interaction, and don't take a hands-off approach when using tutors. I am inclined to recommend public school over all other just because the child will gain social acumen and about as much education as in any other setting &mdash; and, assuming you do everything else right, he will be as free-minded as he ought to be. If the school <em>sucks</em> at teaching in particular areas, they may be remediable with at-home teaching.</p>

<p>Failing all of that, you could move to Finland&hellip;<sup><a href="#fn-edu-in-finland">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="closing" class="separator">Closing<a class="para-ref" href="#closing"></a></h2>

<p>I think this will do as a summary: teach objectivity, question the mind about the world, don't restrict the mind, don't penalize the mind for out-of-place thought and, finally, <strong>don't</strong> screw up the whole ‘education’ thing &mdash; it's amazingly easy, apparently.</p>

<p>NB: This was never meant as a blight against my parents, and I still hold some respect for them for not destroying all chance of remediation, and for not disowning me. I'm sure I've managed to overstate something; years of introspection are bound to modify memory.</p>

<p>Anyhow, thank you for reading. Oh, and Ernie says goodbye.</p>

<p>“Alack!” he cried, “my vision was clouded from the truth; I beg forgiveness for my actions!”</p>

<p>Ardet looked upon him with a scowl. “Forgiveness is not yours to beg,  nor is it ours to offer; redemption is lost to those who have fallen.” He motioned to the man's captors, and they dragged him out of the chamber.</p>

<p>“For a moment I thought you would have him slain, brother,” a towering Ascendant boomed as he entered, his words echoing throughout the chamber.</p>

<p>“Death will bring no justice, Daelik, and the dead do not speak the tongues of man.”</p>

<p>“You are blinded by your justice. Sooner would the tides shift with the fallen crushed than rotting unseen!”</p>

<p>Ardet barely began a taut response when a monk broke her torpid meditation: “My brothers, we gain nothing from questioning the actions of our peers &mdash; we are given charge by our strengths for a reason. Daelik, I believe you can see clearly enough that such brutish tactics will only further this evil. The flames will be quenched only after we are in harmony.”</p>

<p>“What do you know, with your mind so detached from this world! We need to assert the Order's strength for humanity to survive. Fear is a tool not exclusive to evil!”</p>

<p>“Enith is right, brother. Wanton violence wrought this unholy cause, and more will only serve to feed it.”</p>

<p>“And yet this course of inaction returns nothing,” Daelik uttered as he stormed out.</p>

<p>Upon this Enith shut her eyes and sat again on the resplendent stone floor. She appeared to be in a lucid trance, turning her head to and fro in abrupt but slow movements; her expression shifting from joy to anger, ecstasy to grimace.</p>

<p>The monks of yore were taught by the Balance of a “plane of time,” a hidden facet of the world which only the attuned and enlightened can access. Enith once described it as an “immeasurable coalescent stream of sound, light, and script; ephemeral strands of pasts and futures forming and dissolving constantly.”</p>

<p>Ardet sat in front of her, calming himself. “What is it, sister? What fates are foreseen?”</p>

<p>A grim twitch, as though heartstrings were plucked.</p>

<p><em>“Ere they came, Malice clenched the world and burned it. Strong ones sought to protect it. Valor embodied them, and Malice was subdued. Bore of this spring, the Ascendant Order kept peace for ages.”</em></p>

<p>Flat and undertone, the words never seemed to come from her directly, as though the flesh were an instrument of unseen agents. It often began with ancient times, like a continually recounting narrative of life, and the words were always framed as a past that exists.</p>

<p><em>“But humanity lost its purity. Malice burned the world again and blood flowed; legion skies burst with crimson storm, aching unease. The world saw chaos and war. The Order was tested.”</em></p>

<p>Once silent, Enith suddenly fell forward, limp; Ardet caught her and laid her head onto a cushion. The journey is always followed by a deep sleep, the body sapped of energy.</p>

<p>Ardet stood and walked through a hall to a large balcony towering over Renaka: the Ascendant Order's birthplace, a massive sprawl of human architecture. The season is mid-Autumn. Dark clouds and sparks on the horizon tell of a gathering storm.</p>

<p>Ardet takes a deep breath of the cool air.</p>

<p>“Our test begins.”</p>

<p><small>* The linked site is Flash; see <a href="http://easypiecescomic.com/html">here</a> for a (less-complete) HTML version. Also, all links to the comic below (and on the site) are PDFs. It's worth it!</small></p>

<p>Where to begin!</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Seriously, where do I begin? Neil Dvorak is one intriguing person. <em>Genuinly</em> intriguing. So intriguing that I'd befriend him if only to figure out his brain, to learn what amalgamation of experiences formed it into such a mass of awesome. Luckily, he gives us a peek.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://pioneerone.tv">Pioneer One</a><sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> was my first encounter with him. I had never heard of Neil Dvorak at the time, but his <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/t9KNf48yvfA">opening sequence</a> for the show stuck with me. Its combination of mechanical behavior and superb line art set the feel of the show &mdash; at least for me. A piano piece plays to give the series its signature in sound, but it's only the somewhat overly-sugary icing on the (delicious and moist) cake.</p>

<p>And that was it. I mean, it was nice and it fit well, but, as I said, it seemed like a one-off. And it was more representative of his art (which is very good) than anything else (such as the awesomeness and quirkiness he puts into his own works). It didn't warrant even a cursory investigation to me at the time.</p>

<p>So, skipping past a few months from the end of Pioneer One, I come upon a tweet mentioning this odd comic called <a target="_blank" href="http://easypiecescomic.com">Easy Pieces</a>. I read through it a bit and readily recalled that opening sequence, remarking how similar, how unique the style was. After some more poking around, I confirmed that he was indeed the person responsible for Pioneer One's art.</p>

<p>Easy Pieces is something special &mdash; and it evades any explanation of mine, so I won't attempt to give one. In <a target="_blank" href="http://neildvorak.com/EasyPieces/EasyIntro.pdf">the intro</a>, we get the first glimpse of his gorgeous vectorized art and metaphoric nature &mdash; even by then I'm wholly invested. It only gets better &ndash; and crazier &ndash; with <a target="_blank" href="http://neildvorak.com/EasyPieces/AGregAndJettAdventure.pdf">A Greg &amp; Jett Adventure</a>, which is fantastically hilarious and certainly one of my favorites. The comic mostly speaks for itself, so I'll leave the rest up to you (there are a total of 7 strips and 2 interactive/animated things).</p>

<p>He also apparently did some <a target="_blank" href="http://neildvorak.com/strip/past">cartography</a> and some inexplicable illustrations which you might find interesting: <a target="_blank" href="http://neildvorak.com/strip/ocre">Ocre Piece</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://neildvorak.com/strip/blue">Blue Piece</a>.</p>

<p>This was supposed to be short, so I'll just end with this: Neil Dvorak, keep being awesome &mdash; and make more Easy Pieces!</p>

	<title>Hackers disrupt OPS surveillance third time this quarter</title>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Hacker group ‘pecker’ (suspected of belonging to the rising underground) has once again attacked the local Orean Public Security surveillance network, “exploiting critical infrastructure,” so says head network engineer Wayne Essin of OPS.

<p>“On a normal day we receive on the order of four- to seven-thousand probes per minute, many of which are harmless botnets hapazardly knocking on anything they run into. I say harmless because the probes they make are mostly to our public network &ndash; which is just as heavily fortified as our separate internal network &ndash; and because these botnets are typically dumber than an adolescent series 1 Galvin NN. These rarely make it into our networks, and if they do we make quick work of the hole and anything touched automatically gets patched over. Successful attacks are quite uncommon, especially under constant and vigilant scanning.</p>

<p>“The so-called ‘pecker’ hacker(s) initially gained access to the internal network by hijacking an active connection, but were stopped short by our security protocols. We estimate they took about two days to find a hole and craft an exploit for it, after which they quietly compromised several nodes and set off an array of exploits all at once. For the second attack, they used a hidden backdoor in one of the compromised nodes (which was only caught during the attack) and took the same trial-and-error approach.</p>

<p>“We're still analyzing the third attack, but it appears they've set an advanced decoy botnet against the network to shadow a much more sophisticated attack directly aimed at the surveillance and communication networks. The decoy botnet has brought us around 340,000 probes per minute at peak activity.”</p>

<p>OPS have reported several crimes executed during these attacks; it is unknown if these were happenstance, taking of opportunity, or in concert. There are also some crimes which <em>weren't</em> reported and are still under media blackout.</p>

<h3>Generation against the flow</h3>

<p>Concerned citizens are petitioning for more force against the underground to prevent the uprisal of a cohesive rebel group &mdash; which is proving quite hard to track due to ongoing cyber warfare against the state. Proponents have cited many issues: poor working conditions, inadequate protection and health services for Oranium miners, despotism in the government, market manipulation by private parties, and so on. Some believe the lack of OPS pressure is because they fear media attention &mdash; widespread recognition of state issues.</p>

<p>The new generation is more daring and less complacent, something that has echoed through the years as the government trips over its many promises. If things don't change to their liking, we may very well see a violent uprising.</p>

<p>Sooo, this is pretty interesting. I wonder why they never took off. I know people in this day and age &ndash; such as myself &ndash; that can't even go without GPS outside of their familiar zone. Perhaps there was once a time when transit was less complex&hellip;</p>

<p>At least we get to have some fun with wordplay: <em>The map that's always at hand! Shock your friends as you reason your place from the very lines on the palm of your hand!</em></p>

<p>Ever-crafty <a target="_blank" href="http://jteeuwen.nl">Teeuwen</a> has given this remark: <span title="HAHAHAHAHA. Ha. Haaah. Okay; okay. I'm done.">“those are some handy maps AHAHAHAHA.”</span></p>

<p>And on that bombshell I make my exit.</p>

<blockquote class="excerpt">


<p>It seems like the quintessentially contemporary phenomenon: the pedestrian, walking along, distracted from his surroundings by the glow of the map in his smartphone.</p>

<p>But there have been some oblivious palm-gazers, it turns out, since long before Steve Jobs came along&hellip;</p>

	<title>The wrongness of metadata on Grooveshark</title>

<p>Most people are unwittingly terrible at handling music metadata. They also seemingly take great measures to run said music through a grate, lightly toast it and, finally, smother with a strange, sticky substance. These sticky musics somehow found their way into <a href="http://blog.grooveshark.com" target="_blank">Grooveshark</a>, a service that apparently enjoys suffering.</p>

<p><span title="I mean, when I have to. Quite frankly, I barely use the site anymore.">And I can hardly stand it</span>.</p>

<p>When your users have to manually search through duplicate &ndash; sometimes <em>triplicate</em> or moreplicate &ndash; tracks from the same album or artist just to build a chronologically-ordered playlist, you are doing something wrong. Since users push-started Grooveshark with upbloated content (you should already know where I'm going with this), what Grooveshark ended up consisting of, succinctly, is this: a myriad of collections with metadata in every possible form of <strong>wrong</strong>. Though, artists can actually edit their own uploaded music's metadata, so they are less of an issue &mdash; but an issue nonetheless. The majority probably don't know what any of this “metadata” mumbo jumbo even means.</p>

<p>Anywho, have a look-see at <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#!/search?q=flcl" target="_blank">this search for FLCL</a>. It illustrates the following <strong>wrongs</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>incorrectly translated data;</li>
	<li>incorrectly placed data (half of the damned tracks have “Anime” as the artist!);</li>
	<li>incorrectly cased data (all too often);</li>
	<li>incorrectly encoded data;</li>
	<li>partial data;</li>
	<li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This <strong>wrongery</strong> isn't limited just to foreign, less-popular artists. You can find plenty examples of these wrongs all over Grooveshark &mdash; go ahead and look around if you're not convinced. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/search?q=Explosions+in+the+Sky" target="_blank">Explosions in the Sky</a> is as good a pick as any other.</p>

<h2 id="suggesticus" class="separator">Suggesticus<a class="para-ref" href="#suggesticus"></a></h2>

<p>Now that I have illustrated my illustrations and listed a list, I shall make a series of suggestions to Grooveshark. First, users should be asked the following (quite reasonable) questions before they can upload music:</p>
<ul>
	<li>“Do we already have this collection?” (gently offering the user a giant search bar, enticing them to be sure); and</li>
	<li>“Did you use a flamethrower on the metadata?” (if so they should be immediately ostracized).</li>
</ul>

<p>Second (and I'm surprised this isn't already a part of the service &mdash; it truly boggles the mind), Grooveshark should fix tags automagically. They could assumedly easily utilize <a href="http://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a> to fix a majority of the partially- and incorrectly-tagged collections.</p>

<p>If a user attempts to upload a collection that has already been uploaded, theirs should be rejected; or if the uploaded collection completes a matching <em>partial</em> collection, the two should be merged. Collections that were not found in the MusicBrainz database should either be rejected (this will happen when the tags are mostly incorrect or wholly nonexistent, though PUIDs could potentially be used to alleviate this in some cases) or marked as ‘uncertain’ (see below).</p>

<p>Finally, users should be able to edit tags. I'm aware of the difficulties and possible downsides in such a prospect, but it can be done and Grooveshark and their users will benefit greatly from such a feature. As I mentioned above, unrecognized collections could be marked as ‘uncertain’, the idea being that users can tell apart properly and unproperly tagged collections and correct them where necessary. There should at least be a rating or reporting system so that trolls can be punished, or banished entirely from changing tags.</p>

<p>This <strong>wrongery</strong> is nearly my own complaint with Grooveshark &mdash; and it is admittedly a very big one. I find them otherwise to be an excellent music streaming service. They're also surprisingly good at dodging litigation in an age where publishers have aged ideals &mdash; they are in the rich kid's sandbox, and the rich kid is dangerously powerful.</p>
