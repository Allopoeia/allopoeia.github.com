# Alright Scotty, what the heck is this thing?

[Allopoeia](http://allopoeia.komiga.com) is an open-authorship journal/blag for anything and everything, created by [plash](http://komiga.com) (and his sledgehammer).

## *Anything?*

[Sorta kinda](http://allopoeia.komiga.com/authoring.html). It depends on a lot of things: the editors' moods, how much tea plash has had within a 12-hour period, whether Pluto is categorized as a dwarf planet (oh hey look at that, you're in luck), whether it is a Wednesday (sledgehammer polishing day — don't *ever* interrupt plash when he's having private time with his sledges), etc. etc.

In truth, it's all about **mannerism** (to summarize without actually explaining anything).

### So.. a photo journal of my cat? An essay on the more subtle qualities of cereal? Blaming plash for all the horrible things in my life?

Basically, yeah. Cats are cool; cereal is nice… maybe not that last one.

## For why?

*Why not!* That's our best response.
