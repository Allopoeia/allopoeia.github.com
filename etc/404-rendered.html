<p>You find yourself in some <span title="hi; nice to meet you">abyss</span>. You strain yourself to hear something&hellip; <em>anything</em>&hellip; <span title="well duh, you're in an &ldquo;abyss&rdquo;">Not a pip</span>. <span title="I don't know who this guy is, but he's got real nerve ignoring me like that">There's no one here but yourself</span> &mdash; you can almost <em>feel</em> the absence of things.
All you <em>are</em> certain of is <span title="brr! &ndash; poor you &ndash; brrrr!">the coldness</span> of this place&hellip; Wait, what's this!? <span title="there is a god! you're saved!">A stack of lightly-toasted waffles</span> at your side. <span title="in my hands, they'd already be devoured">Alas, they won't last long</span> &mdash; the void itself is draining your energy. <span title="watch out guys, we've got a Sherlock over here"><em>&ldquo;I've gotta get out of this place,&rdquo;</em></span> you murmur.</p>

<p>Whilst <span title="are you going to share?">nibbling on the waffles</span>, you search the area. The ground &ndash; if you could call it that &ndash; <span title="it feels like a unicorn; trust me, I'd know">is unlike any material your fingers have felt before</span>. There is no wind; everything is stagnant; you can only smell yourself <span title="are you done yet? maybe if I say please? pretty please give me a waffle?">and the waffles</span>.</p>

<p>Another object! It seems to be a <span title="well, you won't have to worry about strags any longer&hellip;">large towel</span>. You wrap it around yourself, attempting to fend off the bitter cold. <strong><span title="just hand them over already; you're going to get fat">More nibbling</span>.</strong></p>

<p><span title="are you even listening to me? helloooo?">After stumbling about some more</span>, you come upon a large&hellip; <span title="&#9834; it's a unicornnn &#9834;">something</span> &mdash; you decide against trying to christen it. It is seemingly gargantuan, and hard as stone; <span title="yup, unicorn">its surface is smooth, yet strewn with jagged facets</span>.
<em>&ldquo;How bizarre&hellip;&rdquo;</em> Feeling around the <span title="unicorn; get it right">something</span>, it seems to be blocking some kind of opening.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe I can push it aside&hellip;&rdquo;</em> <strong><span title="look at yourself, you're so fat! big fat fatty!">Nibble, nibble&ndash; scarfing down the remainders</span>.</strong>
Folding the towel around your upper arm for protection, you prop yourself against the side of <span title="how many times do I have to say this? it's a unicorn. UNI. CORN. if it makes you feel any better, I'll let you call it a wildebeast. they're practically the same except for the whole horn thing and&ndash;">the facety something</span>.</p>

<p><strong><span title="&ndash; waiiit!! don't leave mee&ndash;">Push! Puuush! Puu</span><span title="&ndash;eeeee!">&ndash; <em>falling!</em></span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Flood of light!</strong></em> You find yourself in a painfully bright room, seated in a chair in front of <span title="h-hello? I'm still here!? this has never happened before!">an unfamiliar wall-mounted digital screen</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Rub eyes.</strong> &hellip; <em>&ldquo;Where am I&hellip;?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Ding!</strong> The screen draws your attention. <span title="oh god, please tell me it isn't her&hellip;">Text appears</span>; it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span title="HELL-O-COM-PUTE-R.  WE-COME-IN-PEAS.">Greetings, #404</span>! If you're reading this, you've just fatefully passed through &ndash; <span title="you are, haha you're really panicking">don't panic!</span> &ndash; <span title="bet'cha 20 units it's a unicorn">Bakgannon's</span> <span title="I heard from a reputable source &ndash; no, not my cousin; don't you dare say it &ndash; that they make these entirely out of lasers">Wormhole</span>. The fact that you're reading this right now means you're perfectly fine!</p>

<p>Link up to <a title="it is her! I wonder what she's destroying now" href="mailto:allopoeia+bakgannon@komiga.com"><em>E-H-4421-0-79#KM</em></a> with tag BKG-n8 for debriefing. Also, since you're in node 8, make sure you flush the system before you do anything (that series 7 tech is unstable with stacking). Also also, <span title="you're screwwed!">diagbots should be running scans</span> to ensure you aren't contaminated &mdash; purely a precaution; <em>in linteo confidimus!</em></p>

<p>P.S. There have been reported sightings of <span title="ugh, she says it like they don't exist">&ldquo;waffles&rdquo;</span> (a mass-produced foodstuff from DC 20) in the BKG. <span title="she's just playing mind games with you; they're perfectly harmless. yeah, yeah; I lied about you being fat, and for that I apologize">If you come across them, don't even look at them funny &mdash; they are incredibly potent. If you happen to have ignored all reason by eating the waffles, get yourself into isolation immediately &mdash; the diagbots can't get a reading on them for some reason.</span></p>

<p>You are left bewildered, and absolutely covered in crumbs. To your surprise, the towel is still with you, and incredibly clean.</p>

<p>Nothing changes. No &lsquo;diagbots&rsquo;, and no change on the screen&hellip;</p>
