<p>You find yourself in some <span title="omigosh! whatever shall we do?">black abyss</span>. <span title="what part of &ldquo;black abyss&rdquo; don't you understand?">You strain yourself to hear</span> something&hellip; <em>anything</em>&hellip; <span title="you're a real dork, you know that?">Not a pip &mdash; nothing whatsoever</span>. <span title="I don't know who this guy is, but he's got real nerve ignoring me like that">There's no one here but yourself</span> &mdash; you can almost <em>feel</em> the absence of things. The only thing you can sense with certainty is <span title="brr! &ndash; poor you &ndash; brrrr!">the coldness</span> of this place&hellip; Wait, what's this!? <span title="there is a god! we're saved!">A stack of lightly-toasted waffles</span> at your side. <span title="in my hands, they'd already be devoured">Alas, they won't last long</span> &mdash; the void itself is draining your energy. <span title="watch out guys, we've got a Sherlock over here"><em>&ldquo;I've gotta get out of this place&rdquo;,</em></span> you murmur.</p>

<p>Whilst <span title="oh, oh, lemme have one!">nibbling on the waffles</span>, you search the area. The ground &ndash; if you could call it that &ndash; <span title="it feels like a unicorn; trust me, I'd know">is unlike any material your fingers have felt before</span>. There is no wind; everything is stagnant; you can only smell yourself and the waffles.</p>

<p>Another object! It seems to be a <span title="well, we won't have to worry about strags any longer&hellip;">large towel</span>. You wrap it around yourself, attempting to fend off the bitter cold. <strong><span title="give. me. some. waffles!">More nibbling</span>.</strong></p>

<p>After stumbling about some more, you come upon a large&hellip; <span title="&#9834; it's a unicornnn &#9834;">something</span> &mdash; you give up trying to christen it. <em>&ldquo;Stop wasting energy!&rdquo;</em> It is much taller and larger than you and rigid as stone; <span title="yup, unicorn">its surface is smooth, yet strewn with jagged facets</span>. Feeling around the <span title="unicorn; get it right">something</span>, it seems to be blocking an opening.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe I can push it aside&hellip;&rdquo;</em> <strong><span title="look at yourself, you're so fat! fatty! dammit. give me some waffles already. seriously.">Nibble, nibble&ndash; scarfing down the remainders</span>.</strong> <span title="..what are you doing">Folding the towel around your upper arm for protection</span>, you prop yourself against the side of <span title="how many times do I have to say this? it's a unicorn. UNI. CORN. look, if it makes you feel any better, you can call it a giant wildebeast, they're practically the same except for the whole horn thing and&ndash;">the facety something</span>.</p>

<p><strong><span title="&ndash; waiiit!! don't leave mee&ndash;">Push; push; pu</span>&ndash; <span title="&ndash;eeeee!"><em>a falling sensation</em></span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Flood of light!</strong></em> You suddenly find yourself back in a familiar place: <span title="h-hello? oh, I'm still here; wow, dude, you scared me back there">in the warm company of your shiny computer</span>. <span title="hmmmm">Text appears</span>; it reads: &ldquo;If you're reading this, you've just stumbled into <span title="also a unicorn">Bakgannon's</span> <span title="little known fact: it's actually made entirely out of lasers">Wormhole</span>, <span title="ah&ndash;  side-lining the unicorns, as always">on which no further explanation is necessary</span>. <span title="yeahh, how 'bout no?">If you could send an e-mail</span> to <a title="more like allopoeia+unicorns@komiga.com, am I right?" href="mailto:allopoeia+bakgannon@komiga.com">allopoeia+bakgannon@komiga.com</a> explaining just how you escaped, <span title="buzz off, missy. I see right through your deception &ndash; you're not getting any waffles!">that'd be fantastic</span>. P.S. <span title="she's just playing mind games with you; I've been eating these things ever since I ended up in here and I'm doing just fine &mdash; I'm perfectly normal!">Don't eat the waffles (you'll understand later).</span> &mdash; <span title="&hellip; Kosher Meat? I don't get her at all">K. M.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>You are left bewildered, and absolutely covered in crumbs. To your surprise the towel is incredibly clean and skillfully embroidered with magnificent waffles. <em>&ldquo;Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm still alive and I even get to keep this awesome towel!&rdquo;</em></p>
