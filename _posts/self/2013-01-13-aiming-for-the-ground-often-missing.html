<p>My projects are rather anomalous. There are few reasons they exist:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I had a curiosity.</li>
	<li>I had a bucket full of spare time.</li>
	<li>I had a need for something (typically becoming generic).</li>
</ol>

<p>That's essentially how it goes for everyone else, right? Right.</p>

<p>New projects involve a bunch of deliberation over design, which, I admit, becomes unhealthy somewhere around the umpteenth pass. Often, a project is left in some manner of limbo, or is never christened with a public shell (which usually comes down to how interesting I find it to be,<sup><a href="#fn-project-interestingness">1</a></sup> regardless of how useful it is). I have learned much through horrible design (specifically: of realizing it after the fact) and I think it is <em>good</em> to fail, but I'm finding it more and more difficult to accept minuscule defects. My scrutiny core won't shutdown. I suspect the cause of this runs deeper than I'm willing to explore at present.</p>

<p>There are also, of course, the distractions. It is easy to get lost in the cornucopia of information that is the Internet.</p>

<p>While I'm here, I'll just get this out of my system: in August 2012 I received an email from a Google recruiter on a hunt. On the face of it, they were likely just flipping through GitHub users, searching for people to fill seats in their new offices, but I digress. The prospect is simultaneously appealing and terrifying. Part of me just wants to experience it, and another part is (very rightly so) screaming “unqualified”.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> significant concerns here. For one, I'm very much the opposite of a web person. I hate web tech; I think it's all schizophrenic.<sup><a href="#fn-schizo-tech">2</a></sup> Even if they're trying to fill a backend position, I'm still not the right person. I'm a sciolist, and I think that was recognized in the mock interview, seeing as they placed me in a pile and want to review my skills at some later date.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think they need to review their rules for probing GitHub.</p>

<p>However, since I have no other foreseeable future, I am somewhat aiming towards this end. If I don't end up with a job: no big deal. It would be a relief, really. And I will have learned a few good things. If I <em>do</em> end up with a job: a kind of validation, in a sense? I can just leave if it's not all it's chalked up to be (which I am highly suspicious about). Maybe this is all self-denial and it doesn't really take a master to fit in at Google. We shall see.</p>

<h2 id="side-b" class="separator">Side B: Goals for 2013<a class="para-ref" href="#side-b"></a></h2>

<p>For one, I want to replace Jekyll, which I loath greatly. I have a very primordial design in the works, but I haven't decided which charming language to use. It will probably be Go. <em>Not</em> Ruby.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda is to rebuild my log keeper, which is currently hobbled together with Gtk♯ (a notably fickle, possibly dead wrapper). There will be two components to this: a core library and a CLI application. At some point I want to introduce a distributed model.</p>

<p>In the same vein, I want to make a loose time tracker for Android &mdash; either to tie into my <a target="_blank" href="http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/">Hamster</a> database, or to replace it entirely. I hope this does not turn into a Hamster port. Java makes me sad. Python does too, but not as effectively as Java.</p>

<p>Then there's the broker/load distributor/whatchamacallit. Basically, a library (and highly configurable application) for quickly slapping ØMQ schemes together. I'm not really sure why I started this, but it's a fun idea. It's also half-way done.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to clean up and open-source my core game engine. I did a lot of backend work for an RPG &ndash; hardly a sane undertaking &ndash; that is probably useful to some crazy person somewhere.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of other things I'd like to do, but I won't boor this post with them.</p>
