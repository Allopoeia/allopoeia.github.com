<p>I have no words.</p>

<p>&hellip; Okay, I have <em>some</em> words.</p>

<p>First, an overview. My software repackaging contract finally ended on May 31, after 3 years and 5 months. I sacked <a href="https://github.com/komiga/murk" target="_blank">murk</a> and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Cacophony" target="_blank">Cacophony</a>. I significantly advanced the whole of <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Beard" target="_blank">Beard</a> (most notably, focus handling). I moved <a href="https://github.com/komiga/am" target="_blank">AM‽</a>'s linear operators out-of-class and restructured the hash interface. I went through two command schemes in <a href="https://github.com/komiga/hord" target="_blank">Hord</a>, developed an initial table storage model, and reworked the fundamental object structure. I broke Clang at least three times and found an error in libc++. I started <a href="https://github.com/komiga/togo" target="_blank">togo</a> on June 22. I playtested the Linux port of Antichamber and reported <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vqZq60K.jpg" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IQjwJMr.jpg" target="_blank">bugs</a> in the Linux version of Among the Sleep.</p>

<p>I lived with my brother in Berkeley, California from August 2 to October 31 (90 days). While there, I made <a href="http://komiga.com/#onomo" target="_blank">Onomo</a> for Ludum Dare 30, had a battery fully discharge into my arm over 24 hours, attended GameDevDrinkUp in San Francisco (twice), attended QGCon, and failed to acquire employment. I observed that several factors, especially environment and social space, are dwarfed by discipline and motivation when it comes to <em>doing</em>. My discipline and motivation were largely not positively affected by the (little) improvement of these factors, and my continued lack of them was as ruinous as ever. There is undoubtedly a strength in harmony between environmental &amp; contextual factors and discipline &amp; motivation, and I've found that the positive presence of one side does not necessarily bring about the same to the other.</p>

<p>Back in Ohio, nothing of much note occurred beyond my attendance to the Texts and Contexts Conference in Columbus. Oh, and a <em>copious</em> display of privilege during the holidays. We are afforded too much.</p>

<p>That may <em>seem</em> like a lot, but it still doesn't <em>feel</em> like it, even when I write it all out. I was distraught between the high points at best, and rarely determined enough to do anything consistently.</p>

<p>As for the interests jotted out in my <a href="/self/2014/01/2013-notes-and-data.html" target="_blank">post for 2013</a>, none have been thoroughly advanced. I've done very little with SuperCollider, and I didn't learn any music theory. I forget the exact causes, but it's most likely from the lack of motivation and, in the latter case, because I had just begun developing togo.</p>

<p>I feel most of the year was wasted, despite having spent the largest amount of time on projects since 2011. My greatest difficulty is <em>applying</em> what I know about&hellip; well, everything. Design and execution, primarily. Premature optimization, eternal black holes of design, unbridled habits. I know these mechanics on a deep level, but I don't utilize the knowledge to prevent them. At least I now know (quantitatively <em>and</em> practically) where the wasteful hot spots are in the gamut of my behaviors.</p>

<p>My immediate goals for 2015 are: 1. eradicating waste, 2. improving discipline (especially as motivation has proven unreliable), and 3. developing a game. I will construct a weekly schedule and test variations as I push <a href="https://github.com/komiga/Onsang" target="_blank">Onsang</a> to the point of reasonable usability. By either that point or the end of January, I will allot time towards togo and a game.</p>

<p>With all of this in hand, the only deciding factor in my success is willpower. Given my abusive, hyper-exhaustive approach to design, the best motto for me is Just Do It™.</p>

<p>So I will.</p>

<h2 id="data" class="separator">Data<a class="para-ref" href="#data"></a></h2>

<p>I tracked a total of 8753.3 hours in 2014 with 16177 entries (1827 greater than in 2013). 6.7 hours were (probably) gobbled up by micro discontinuities and weird software. On a bright note, that's only half the time lost during 2013!</p>

<p>One speculative lesson in my 3 years, 9 months, and 28 days of time tracking is that the mere amount of time you sleep has no effect on productivity (provided it is at least healthy). Proper segmenting does, for sure, but there are tougher nuts to crack.</p>

<p>Here're some numbers:<sup><a href="#fn-fun-fact">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Existence</strong> (selection of <span class="underline">~3797.1</span> hours):</p>

	<li id="fn-fun-fact">Fun fact: my dream for Onsang endows it with tracking and automatic statistics much deeper than herein. For example: scheduling, vital signs, nutrition, efficiency determinations by sleep and food intake, financing/budgeting, media, and on and on. I already spot-check pulse rate, temperature, S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and weight; I track development by project, work by task, exercise, bio waste, media, and food intake down to the ingredient, volume, and methods of preparation &amp; cooking. Among other things. The details about these segments of time are syntactically coherent and governed by systems that mostly exist only within my head. All I need to do is move the structural and quantitative aspects out of my head and into software. Once Onsang is <em>fully operational</em>, I will have a wealth of supportive information at my fingertips, at a maintenance cost far below its current value.</li>
