title: Authoring

<p>Authoring on Allopoeia is currently very much an ad hoc process. Since The Allo is a static site, it isn't feasible for authors to be given write access, though persons versed in <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git</a> may have their content merged in as an alternative way of publishing.</p>

<p><span title="sacrificial">Offerings</span> and inquiries should be directed to <a href="mailto:allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com">allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com</a>. A nice message will concern itself with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>succinctly describing the proposed content or providing a URL to existing content;</li>
	<li>briefly describing oneself in whatever manner the writer finds natural (for first timers);</li>
	<li>stipulating any conditions to the publication of the content (license, for example); and</li>
	<li>corollary concerns or &ndash; in proper attempts to amuse us &ndash; witticisms or tales of grandeur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any talk of the weather conditions will invariably result in being bluntly refused.</p>

<p>Following further discussion (agreement to the stipulations and the like), the editors will perform the ritual of copy editing and &ndash; somewhere in-between tripping over a waffle iron and skipping lunch &ndash; The Allo will have itself some shiny new data to nurture.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, although The Allo is very much &lsquo;open&rsquo;, we may reject content in our own skewed judgments of appropriate mannerism &mdash; it is as &lsquo;all-encompassing&rsquo; as <em>we</em> permit.</p>

<section id="style-and-content-format">
<h2 class="separator">Style and content format<a class="para-ref" href="#style-and-content-format"></a></h2>

<p>Allopoeia follows a questionably strict style. All content must go through copy editing and proofreading to ensure that the content conforms to said style. The preferred source format is HTML, but content in any other easily-convertible format is also permitted (such as Markdown). The Allo's style is strict insofar as it does not restrict or damage the particular mannerisms of the content &mdash; intentional language butchering, author idiolect, etc.</p>

<p>For instance, a poem &ndash; something inherently imbued with the writer's essence &ndash; would most likely be reproduced entirely verbatim, the only (remote) threat being spelling correction.</p>

<section id="author-copyright">
<h2 class="separator">Author copyright<a class="para-ref" href="#author-copyright"></a></h2>

<p>Authors retain all of the copyrights provided to them under their governments' laws. The quasi-default copyright notice is simply <span title="&ldquo;all rights reserved&rdquo; is deprecated and already implicit in law">&ldquo;&copy; <em>year-range</em> <em>author-name</em>&rdquo;</span>.</p>

<p>An entirely unrequired license can also be included alongside the author's copyright. <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses are greatly encouraged, whereas restrictive licenses are frowned upon and will most likely bar the publication of content.</p>

<p><strong>Allopoeia has a (simple) publication/reproduction license (restricted to the confines of Allopoeia itself) <span title="which is hopefully always indefinite">for as long as the author wishes to keep the content on the site</span></strong> &mdash; explicitly expressed here for protection from especially litigious litigation.</p>
