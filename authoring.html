title: Authoring

<p>Authoring on Allopoeia is currently very much an ad hoc process. No place is set in stone for handing off content (this is currently handled on an individual level). Since The Allo is a static site, it isn't feasible for authors to be given write access, though persons versed in <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git</a> may have their content merged in as an alternative way of publishing.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, though The Allo is very much &lsquo;open&rsquo;, we may reject authorship requests in our own skewed judgements of appropriate mannerism &mdash; it is as &lsquo;all-encompasing&rsquo; as <em>we</em> permit.</p>

<p>Inquiries should be directed to <a href="mailto:allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com">allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com</a>. A nice message will concern itself with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>succinctly describing proposed content or providing a URL to or excerpt of existing content;</li>
	<li>briefly describing oneself in whatever manner the writer finds natural (for first time authors);</li>
	<li>stipulating any conditions to the publication of said content (license, for example); and</li>
	<li>corollary concerns or &ndash; in attempts to amuse The Allo &ndash; witticisms or tales of grandeur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any talk of the current weather will most probably result in being bluntly refused.</p>

<p>Following further discussion, agreement to the stipulations and the like, the editors will perform the ritual of copy editing and &ndash; somewhere in-between tripping over a waffle iron and skipping lunch &ndash; The Allo will have itself some shiny new data to nurture.</p>

<h2 id="style-and-content-format" class="separator">Style and content format<a class="para-ref" href="#style-and-content-format"></a></h2>

<p>Allopoeia follows a questionably strict style, and all content must go through copy editing to ensure that they conform to said style. The preferred source format is HTML, but content in any other easily-convertable format may also be permitted. The Allo's style is strict insofar as it does not restrict or damage the particular mannerisms of the content.</p>

<p>Take a poem, for instance &mdash; something inherently imbued with the writer's touch; the only remotely likely editing to be applied would be language correction, unless a particular flaw was intent on the author's part.</p>

<h2 id="content-copyright" class="separator">Content copyright<a class="para-ref" href="#content-copyright"></a></h2>

<p>Authors retain all of the copyrights provided to them under their governments' laws. The quasi-default copyright notice is simply <span title="&ldquo;all rights reserved&rdquo; is deprecated and already implicit in law">&ldquo;&copy; <em>year-range</em> <em>author-name</em>&rdquo;, but content can also carry a license. <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses are greatly encouraged; NB: dissimilar, restrictive licenses may bar the publication of content. <strong>Allopoeia has publication/reproduction permission <span title="which is hopefully always indefinite">for as long as the author wishes to keep the content on the site</span></strong> &mdash; explicitly expressed here for protection from litigation.</p>
