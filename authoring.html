<p>Authoring on Allopoeia is currently very much an ad hoc process. Since The Allo is a static site, it isn't feasible for authors to be given write access, though persons versed in <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git</a> may have their content merged in as an alternative way of publishing.</p>

<p><span title="sacrificial">Offerings</span> and inquiries should be directed to <a href="mailto:allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com">allopoeia+authoring@komiga.com</a>. A nice message will concern itself with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>succinctly describing the proposed content or providing a URL to existing content;</li>
	<li>briefly describing oneself in whatever manner the writer finds natural (for first timers);</li>
	<li>stipulating any conditions to the publication of the content (license, for example); and</li>
	<li>corollary concerns or &ndash; in proper attempts to amuse us &ndash; witticisms or tales of grandeur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any talk of the weather conditions will invariably result in being bluntly refused.</p>

<p>Following further discussion (agreement to the stipulations and the like), the editors will perform the ritual of copy editing and &ndash; somewhere in-between tripping over a waffle iron and skipping lunch &ndash; The Allo will have itself some shiny new data to nurture.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, though The Allo is very much &lsquo;open&rsquo;, we may reject content in our own skewed judgements of appropriate mannerism &mdash; it is as &lsquo;all-encompasing&rsquo; as <em>we</em> permit.</p>

<p>Allopoeia follows a questionably strict style. All content must go through copy editing and proofreading to ensure that the content conforms to said style. The preferred source format is HTML, but content in any other easily-convertable format is also be permitted. The Allo's style is strict insofar as it does not restrict or damage the particular mannerisms of the content &mdash; intentional language butchering, author idiolect, etc.</p>

<p>For instance, a poem &ndash; something inherently imbued with the writer's touch &ndash; would most likely be reproduced entirely verbatim, the only (remote) threat being spelling correction.</p>

<p>Authors retain all of the copyrights provided to them under their governments' laws. The quasi-default copyright notice is simply <span title="&ldquo;all rights reserved&rdquo; is deprecated and already implicit in law">&ldquo;&copy; <em>year-range</em> <em>author-name</em>&rdquo;</span>, but content can also carry a license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses are greatly encouraged). NB: restrictive licenses may bar the publication of content.</p>

<p><strong>Allopoeia has simple a publication/reproduction license (restricted to the confines of Allopoeia itself) <span title="which is hopefully always indefinite">for as long as the author wishes to keep the content on the site</span></strong> &mdash; explicitly expressed here for protection from especially litigious litigation.</p>
