<p>Here be the authors. They write stuff and <em>probably</em> live life like the rest of you. <span title="there actually aren't any cats here &mdash; what an absurd notion!">Except for the cats</span>.</p>

<p>This creature hails from the meteorologically-unstable state most commonly referred to as <span title="truly a cursed place">Ohio</span>. plash is an introverted, pessimistic, <span title="he also secretly loves contradictions&hellip;">flawed, pedantic perfectionist</span> who spends his days mulling over issues of all magnitudes<span title="and hidden text">,</span> writing code, playing awesome video games, stressing over others' (lack of) literacy in all things, and complaining about his nation's lack of SI adoption and its decrepit state of education (<span title="because of all the horrible things he hears about college and because he detests debt">of which he has none</span>). He is the <span title="actually the only editor">editor in chief</span>, as it were, of <a href="/about.html">The Allo</a>.</p>

<p><span title="and cats!">plash loves video games, computer programming, tea, waffles, books, chiptune, classical music and violins</span>. In another universe he'd be a luthier or a book conservator, but in this he is an <span title="read: an autodidact; home schooled without being properly taught">uneducated</span> time waster who is <span title="the description of &ldquo;pedantic perfectionist&rdquo; is solely his own &mdash; or so he hopes">often wrong</span> and doesn't always recognize when he is.</p>
